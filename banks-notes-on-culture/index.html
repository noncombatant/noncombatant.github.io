It only
exists in my mind and the minds of the people who’ve read about it.</b><p>That having been made clear:<p>The Culture is a group-civilisation formed from seven or eight humanoid
species, space-living elements of which established a loose federation
approximately nine thousand years ago. The ships and habitats which formed the
original alliance required each others’ support to pursue and maintain their
independence from the political power structuresa b—c dprincipally those of mature
nation-states and autonomous commercial concernsa b—c dthey had evolved from.<p>The galaxy (our galaxy) in the Culture stories is a place long lived-in, and
scattered with a variety of life-forms. In its vast and complicated history it
has seen waves of empires, federations, colonisations, die-backs, wars,
species-specific dark ages, renaissances, periods of mega-structure building and
destruction, and whole ages of benign indifference and malign neglect. At the
time of the Culture stories, there are perhaps a few dozen major space-faring
civilisations, hundreds of minor ones, tens of thousands of species who might
develop space-travel, and an uncountable number who have been there, done that,
and have either gone into locatable but insular retreats to contemplate
who-knows-what, or disappeared from the normal universe altogether to cultivate
lives even less comprehensible.<p>In this era, the Culture is one of the more energetic civilisations, and
initiallya b—c dafter its formation, which was not without vicissitudesa b—c dby a
chance of timing found a relatively quiet galaxy around it, in which there were
various other fairly mature civilisations going about their business, traces and
relics of the elder cultures scattered about the place, anda b—c ddue to the fact
nobody else had bothered to go wandering on a grand scale for a comparatively
long timea b—c dlots of interesting ’undiscovered’ star systems to explore...<p>The Culture, in its history and its on-going form, is an expression of the
idea that the nature of space itself determines the type of civilisations which
will thrive there.<p>The thought processes of a tribe, a clan, a country or a nation-state are
essentially two-dimensional, and the nature of their power depends on the same
flatness. Territory is all-important; resources, living-space, lines of
communication; all are determined by the nature of the plane (that the plane is
in fact a sphere is irrelevant here); that surface, and the fact the species
concerned are bound to it during their evolution, determines the mind-set of a
ground-living species. The mind-set of an aquatic or avian species is, of
course, rather different.<p>Essentially, the contention is that our currently dominant power systems
cannot long survive in space; beyond a certain technological level a degree of
anarchy is arguably inevitable and anyway preferable.<p>To survive in space, ships/habitats must be self-sufficient, or very nearly
so; the hold of the state (or the corporation) over them therefore becomes
tenuous if the desires of the inhabitants conflict significantly with the
requirements of the controlling body. On a planet, enclaves can be surrounded,
besieged, attacked; the superior forces of a state or corporationa b—c dhereafter
referred to as hegemoniesa b—c dwill tend to prevail. In space, a break-away
movement will be far more difficult to control, especially if significant parts
of it are based on ships or mobile habitats. The hostile nature of the vacuum
and the technological complexity of life support mechanisms will make such
systems vulnerable to outright attack, but that, of course, would risk the total
destruction of the ship/habitat, so denying its future economic contribution to
whatever entity was attempting to control it.<p>Outright destruction of rebellious ships or habitatsa b—c dpour encouragez les
autresa b—c dof course remains an option for the controlling power, but all the
usual rules of uprising realpolitik still apply, especially that concerning the
peculiar dialectic of dissent whicha b—c dsimply stateda b—c ddictates that in all but
the most dedicatedly repressive hegemonies, if in a sizable population there are
one hundred rebels, all of whom are then rounded up and killed, the number of
rebels present at the end of the day is not zero, and not even one hundred, but
two hundred or three hundred or more; an equation based on human nature which
seems often to baffle the military and political mind. Rebellion, then (once
space-going and space-living become commonplace), becomes easier than it might
be on the surface of a planet.<p>Even so, this is certainly the most vulnerable point in the time-line of the
Culture’s existence, the point at which it is easiest to argue for things
turning out quite differently, as the extent and sophistication of the
hegemony’s control mechanismsa b—c dand its ability and will to repressa b—c dbattles
against the ingenuity, skill, solidarity and bravery of the rebellious ships and
habitats, and indeed the assumption here is that this point has been reached
before and the hegemony has won... but it is also assumed thata b—c dfor the reasons
given abovea b—c dthat point is bound to come round again, and while the forces of
repression need to win every time, the progressive elements need only triumph
once.<p>Concomitant with this is the argument that the nature of life in spacea b—c dthat
vulnerability, as mentioned abovea b—c dwould mean that while ships and habitats
might more easily become independent from each other and from their legally
progenitative hegemonies, their crewa b—c dor inhabitantsa b—c dwould always be aware of
their reliance on each other, and on the technology which allowed them to live
in space. The theory here is that the property and social relations of long-term
space-dwelling (especially over generations) would be of a fundamentally
different type compared to the norm on a planet; the mutuality of dependence
involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate an
internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness
typifying the relations between such ships/habitats. Succinctly; socialism
within, anarchy without. This broad result isa b—c din the long runa b—c dindependent of
the initial social and economic conditions which give rise to it.<p>Let me state here a personal conviction that appears, right now, to be
profoundly unfashionable; which is that a planned economy can be more productivea b—c dand more morally desirablea b—c dthan one left to market forces.<p>The market is a good example of evolution in action; the
try-everything-and-see-what-works approach. This might provide a perfectly
morally satisfactory resource-management system so long as there was absolutely
no question of any sentient creature ever being treated purely as one of those
resources. The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains
a crude and essentially blind system, and isa b—c dwithout the sort of drastic
amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed
asseta b—c dintrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of
matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and
wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.<p>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that
sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral,
philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays
most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and]a b—c dthrough
grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of othersa b—c da kind of
synthetic evil.<p>Intelligence, which is capable of looking farther ahead than the next
aggressive mutation, can set up long-term aims and work towards them; the same
amount of raw invention that bursts in all directions from the market can bea b—c dto some degreea b—c dchannelled and directed, so that while the market merely shines
(and the feudal gutters), the planned lases, reaching out coherently and
efficiently towards agreed-on goals. What is vital for such a scheme, however,
and what was always missing in the planned economies of our world’s experience,
is the continual, intimate and decisive participation of the mass of the
citizenry in determining these goals, and designing as well as implementing the
plans which should lead towards them.<p>Of course, there is a place for serendipity and chance in any sensibly
envisaged plan, and the degree to which this would affect the higher functions
of a democratically designed economy would be one of the most important
parameters to be set... but just as the information we have stored in our
libraries and institutions has undeniably outgrown (if not outweighed) that
resident in our genes, and just as we may, within a century of the invention of
electronics, duplicatea b—c dthrough machine sentiencea b—c da process which evolution
took billions of years to achieve, so we shall one day abandon the grossly
targeted vagaries of the market for the precision creation of the planned
economy.<p>The Culture, of course, has gone beyond even that, to an economy so much a
part of society it is hardly worthy of a separate definition, and which is
limited only by imagination, philosophy (and manners), and the idea of minimally
wasteful elegance; a kind of galactic ecological awareness allied to a desire to
create beauty and goodness.<p>Whatever; in the end practice (as ever) will outshine theory.<p>As mentioned above, there is another force at work in the Culture aside from
the nature of its human inhabitants and the limitations and opportunities
presented by life in space, and that is Artificial Intelligence. This is taken
for granted in the Culture stories, anda b—c dunlike FTL travela b—c dis not only likely
in the future of our own species, but probably inevitable (always assuming homo
sapiens avoids destruction).<p>Certainly there are arguments against the possibility of Artificial
Intelligence, but they tend to boil down to one of three assertions: one, that
there is some vital field or other presently intangible influence exclusive to
biological lifea b—c dperhaps even carbon-based biological lifea b—c dwhich may
eventually fall within the remit of scientific understanding but which cannot be
emulated in any other form (all of which is neither impossible nor likely); two,
that self-awareness resides in a supernatural soula b—c dpresumably linked to a
broad-based occult system involving gods or a god, reincarnation or whatevera b—c dand which one assumes can never be understood scientifically (equally
improbable, though I do write as an atheist); and, three, that matter cannot
become self-aware (or more precisely that it cannot support any informational
formulation which might be said to be self-aware or taken together with its
material substrate exhibit the signs of self-awareness). ...I leave all the more
than nominally self-aware readers to spot the logical problem with that
argument.<p>It is, of course, entirely possible that real AIs will refuse to have
anything to do with their human creators (or rather, perhaps, the human creators
of their non-human creators), but assuming that they doa b—c dand the design of
their software may be amenable to optimization in this regarda b—c dI would argue
that it is quite possible they would agree to help further the aims of their
source civilisation (a contention we’ll return to shortly). At this point,
regardless of whatever alterations humanity might impose on itself through
genetic manipulation, humanity would no longer be a one-sentience-type species.
The future of our species would affect, be affected by and coexist with the
future of the AI life-forms we create.<p>The Culture reached this phase at around the same time as it began to inhabit
space. Its AIs cooperate with the humans of the civilisation; at first the
struggle is simply to survive and thrive in space; latera b—c dwhen the technology
required to do so has become mundanea b—c dthe task becomes less physical, more
metaphysical, and the aims of civilisation moral rather than material.<p>Briefly, nothing and nobody in the Culture is exploited. It is essentially an
automated civilisation in its manufacturing processes, with human labour
restricted to something indistinguishable from play, or a hobby.<p>No machine is exploited, either; the idea here being that any job can be
automated in such a way as to ensure that it can be done by a machine well below
the level of potential consciousness; what to us would be a stunningly
sophisticated computer running a factory (for example) would be looked on by the
Culture’s AIs as a glorified calculator, and no more exploited than an insect is
exploited when it pollinates a fruit tree a human later eats a fruit from.<p>Where intelligent supervision of a manufacturing or maintenance operation is
required, the intellectual challenge involved (and the relative lightness of the
effort required) would make such supervision rewarding and enjoyable, whether
for human or machine. The precise degree of supervision required can be adjusted
to a level which satisfies the demand for it arising from the nature of the
civilisation’s members. Peoplea b—c dand, I’d argue, the sort of conscious machines
which would happily cooperate with thema b—c dhate to feel exploited, but they also
hate to feel useless. One of the most important tasks in setting up and running
a stable and internally content civilisation is finding an acceptable balance
between the desire for freedom of choice in one’s actions (and the freedom from
mortal fear in one’s life) and the need to feel that even in a society so
self-correctingly Utopian one is still contributing something. Philosophy
matters, here, and sound education.<p>Education in the Culture is something that never ends; it may be at its most
intense in the first tenth or so of an individual’s life, but it goes on until
death (another subject we’ll return to). To live in the Culture is to live in a
fundamentally rational civilisation (this may preclude the human species from
ever achieving something similar; our history is, arguably, not encouraging in
this regard). The Culture is quite self-consciously rational, sceptical, and
materialist. Everything matters, and nothing does. Vast though the Culture may
bea b—c dthirty trillion people, scattered fairly evenly through the galaxya b—c dit is
thinly spread, exists for now solely in this one galaxy, and has only been
around for an eyeblink, compared to the life of the universe. There is life, and
enjoyment, but what of it? Most matter is not animate, most that is animate is
not sentient, and the ferocity of evolution pre-sentience (and, too often,
post-sentience) has filled uncountable lives with pain and suffering. And even
universes die, eventually. (Though we’ll come back to that, too.)<p>In the midst of this, the average Culture persona b—c dhuman or machinea b—c dknows
that they are lucky to be where they are when they are. Part of their education,
both initially and continually, comprises the understanding that beings less
fortunatea b—c dthough no less intellectually or morally worthya b—c dthan themselves
have suffered and, elsewhere, are still suffering. For the Culture to continue
without terminal decadence, the point needs to be made, regularly, that its easy
hedonism is not some ground-state of nature, but something desirable,
assiduously worked for in the past, not necessarily easily attained, and
requiring appreciation and maintenance both in the present and the future.<p>An understanding of the place the Culture occupies in the history and
development of life in the galaxy is what helps drive the civilisation’s largely
cooperative anda b—c dit would claima b—c dfundamentally benign techno-cultural
diplomatic policy, but the ideas behind it go deeper. Philosophically, the
Culture accepts, generally, that questions such as ’What is the meaning of
life?’ are themselves meaningless. The question impliesa b—c dindeed an answer to it
would demanda b—c da moral framework beyond the only moral framework we can
comprehend without resorting to superstition (and thus abandoning the moral
framework informinga b—c dand symbiotic witha b—c dlanguage itself).<p>In summary, we make our own meanings, whether we like it or not.<p>The same self-generative belief-system applies to the Culture’s AIs. They are
designed (by other AIs, for virtually all of the Culture’s history) within very
broad parameters, but those parameters do exist; Culture AIs are designed to
want to live, to want to experience, to desire to understand, and to find
existence and their own thought-processes in some way rewarding, even
enjoyable.<p>The humans of the Culture, having solved all the obvious problems of their
shared pasts to be free from hunger, want, disease and the fear of natural
disaster and attack, would find it a slightly empty existence only and merely
enjoying themselves, and so need the good-works of the Contact section to let
them feel vicariously useful. For the Culture’s AIs, that need to feel useful is
largely replaced by the desire to experience, but as a drive it is no less
strong. The universea b—c dor at least in this era, the galaxya b—c dis waiting there,
largely unexplored (by the Culture, anyway), its physical principles and laws
quite comprehensively understood but the results of fifteen billion years of the
chaotically formative application and interaction of those laws still far from
fully mapped and evaluated.<p>By Gödel out of Chaos, the galaxy is, in other words, an immensely,
intrinsically, and inexhaustibly interesting place; an intellectual playground
for machines that know everything except fear and what lies hidden within the
next uncharted stellar system.<p>This is where I think one has to ask why any AI civilisationa b—c dand probably
any sophisticated culture at alla b—c dwould want to spread itself everywhere in the
galaxy (or the universe, for that matter). It would be perfectly possible to
build a Von Neumann machine that would build copies of itself and eventually,
unless stopped, turn the universe into nothing but those self-copies, but the
question does arise; why? What is the point? To put it in what we might still
regard as frivolous terms but which the Culture would have the wisdom to take
perfectly seriously, where is the fun in that?<p>Interesta b—c dthe delight in experience, in understandinga b—c dcomes from the
unknown; understanding is a process as well as a state, denoting the shift from
the unknown to the known, from the random to the ordered... a universe where
everything is already understood perfectly and where uniformity has replaced
diversity, would, I’d contend, be anathema to any self-respecting AI.<p>Probably only humans find the idea of Von Neumann machines frightening,
because we half-understanda b—c dand even partially relate toa b—c dthe obsessiveness of
the ethos such constructs embody. An AI would think the idea mad, ludicrous anda b—c dperhaps most damning of alla b—c dboring.<p>This is not to say that the odd Von-Neumann-machine event doesn’t crop up in
the galaxy every now and again (probably by accident rather than design), but
something so rampantly monomaniac is unlikely to last long pitched against
beings possessed of a more rounded wit, and which really only want to alter the
Von Neumann machine’s software a bit and make friends...<p>One idea behind the Culture as it is depicted in the stories is that it has
gone through cyclical stages during which there has been extensive human-machine
interfacing, and other stages (sometimes coinciding with the human-machine eras)
when extensive genetic alteration has been the norm. The era of the stories
written so fara b—c ddating from about 1300 AD to 2100 ADa b—c dis one in which the
people of the Culture have returned, probably temporarily, to something more
‘classical’ in terms of their relations with the machines and the potential of
their own genes.<p>The Culture recognises, expects and incorporates fashionsa b—c dalbeit long-term
fashionsa b—c din such matters. It can look back to times when people lived much of
their lives in what we would now call cyberspace, and to eras when people chose
to alter themselves or their children through genetic manipulation, producing a
variety of morphological sub-species. Remnants of the various waves of such
civilisational fashions can be found scattered throughout the Culture, and
virtually everyone in the Culture carries the results of genetic manipulation in
every cell of their body; it is arguably the most reliable signifier of Culture
status.<p>Thanks to that genetic manipulation, the average Culture human will be born
whole and healthy and of significantly (though not immensely) greater
intelligence than their basic human genetic inheritance might imply. There are
thousands of alterations to that human-basic inheritancea b—c dblister-free
callusing and a clot-filter protecting the brain are two of the less important
ones mentioned in the storiesa b—c dbut the major changes the standard Culture
person would expect to be born with would include an optimized immune system and
enhanced senses, freedom from inheritable diseases or defects, the ability to
control their autonomic processes and nervous system (pain can, in effect, be
switched off), and to survive and fully recover from wounds which would either
kill or permanently mutilate without such genetic tinkering.<p>The vast majority of people are also born with greatly altered glands housed
within their central nervous systems, usually referred to as ’drug glands’.
These secretea b—c don commanda b—c dmooda b—c dand sensory-appreciation-altering compounds
into the person’s bloodstream. A similar preponderance of Culture inhabitants
have subtly altered reproductive organsa b—c dand control over the associated nervesa b—c dto enhance sexual pleasure. Ovulation is at will in the female, and a fetus up
to a certain stage may be re-absorbed, aborted, or held at a static point in its
development; again, as willed. An elaborate thought-code, self-administered in a
trance-like state (or simply a consistent desire, even if not conscious) will
lead, over the course of about a year, to what amounts to a viral change from
one sex into the other. The conventiona b—c dtradition, evena b—c din the Culture during
the time of the stories written so far is that each person should give birth to
one child in their lives. In practice, the population grows slowly. (And
sporadically, in addition, for other reasons, as we’ll come to later.)<p>To us, perhaps, the idea of being able to find out what sex is like for our
complimentary gender, or being able to get drunk/stoned/tripped-out or whatever
just by thinking about it (and of course the Culture’s drug-glands produce no
unpleasant side-effects or physiological addiction) may seem like mere
wish-fulfilment. And indeed it is partly wish-fulfilment, but then the
fulfilment of wishes is both one of civilisation’s most powerful drives and
arguably one of its highest functions; we wish to live longer, we wish to live
more comfortably, we wish to live with less anxiety and more enjoyment, less
ignorance and more knowledge than our ancestors did... but the abilities to
change sex and to alter one’s brain-chemistrya b—c dwithout resort to external
technology or any form of paymenta b—c dboth have more serious functions within the
Culture. A society in which it is so easy to change sex will rapidly find out if
it is treating one gender better than the other; within the population, over
time, there will gradually be greater and greater numbers of the sex it is more
rewarding to be, and so pressure for changea b—c dwithin society rather than the
individualsa b—c dwill presumably therefore build up until some form of sexual
equality and hence numerical parity is established. In a similar fashion, a
society in which everybody is free to, and does, choose to spend the majority of
their time zonked out of their brains will know that there is something
significantly wrong with reality, and (one would hope) do what it can to make
that reality more appealing and lessa b—c din the pejorative sensea b—c dmundane.<p>Implicit in the stories so far is that through self-correcting mechanisms of
this nature the Culture reached a rough steady-state in such matters thousands
of years ago, and has settled into a kind of long-lived civilisational main
sequence which should last for the forseeable future, and thousands of
generations.<p>Which brings us to the length of those generations, and the fact that they
can be said to exist at all. Humans in the Culture normally live about
three-and-a-half to four centuries. The majority of their lives consists of a
three-century plateau which they reach in what we would compare to our
mid-twenties, after a relatively normal pace of maturation during childhood,
adolescence and early adulthood. They age very slowly during those three hundred
years, then begin to age more quickly, then they die.<p>Philosophy, again; death is regarded as part of life, and nothing, including
the universe, lasts forever. It is seen as bad manners to try and pretend that
death is somehow not natural; instead death is seen as giving shape to life.<p>While burial, cremation and othera b—c dto usa b—c dconventional forms of body
disposal are not unknown in the Culture, the most common form of funeral
involves the deceaseda b—c dusually surrounded by friendsa b—c dbeing visited by a
Displacement Drone, whicha b—c dusing the technique of near-instantaneous
transmission of a remotely induced singularity via hyperspacea b—c dremoves the
corpse from its last resting place and deposits it in the core of the relevant
system’s sun, from where the component particles of the cadaver start a
million-year migration to the star’s surface, to shinea b—c dpossiblya b—c dlong after
the Culture itself is history.<p>None of this, of course, is compulsory (nothing in the Culture is
compulsory). Some people choose biological immortality; others have their
personality transcribed into AIs and die happy feeling they continue to exist
elsewhere; others again go into Storage, to be woken in more (or less)
interesting times, or only every decade, or century, or aeon, or over
exponentially increasing intervals, or only when it looks like something really
different is happening...<p>Culture starshipsa b—c dthat is all classes of ship above inter-planetarya b—c dare
sentient; their Minds (sophisticated AIs working largely in hyperspace to take
advantage of the higher lightspeed there) bear the same relation to the fabric
of the ship as a human brain does to the human body; the Mind is the important
bit, and the rest is a life-support and transport system. Humans and independent
drones (the Culture’s non-android individual AIs of roughly human-equivalent
intelligence) are unnecessary for the running of the starships, and have a
status somewhere between passengers, pets and parasites.<p>The Culture’s largest vesselsa b—c dapart from certain art-works and a few
Eccentricsa b—c dare the General Systems Vehicles of the Contact section. (Contact
is the part of the Culture concerned with discovering, cataloguing,
investigating, evaluating anda b—c dif thought prudenta b—c dinteracting with other
civilisations; its rationale and activities are covered elsewhere, in the
stories.) The GSVs are fast and very large craft, measured in kilometres and
inhabited by millions of people and machines. The idea behind them is that they
represent the Culture, fully. All that the Culture knows, each GSV knows;
anything that can be done anywhere in the Culture can be done within or by any
GSV. In terms of both information and technology, they represent a last resort,
and act like holographic fragments of the Culture itself, the whole contained
within each part.<p>In our terms, the abilities of a GSV are those ofa b—c dat leasta b—c da large state,
and arguably a whole planet (subject only to the proviso that even the Culture
prefers to scoop up matter rather than create it from nothing; GSVs do require
raw material).<p>Contact is a relatively small part of the whole Culture, however, and the
average Culture citizen will rarely encounter a GSV or other Contact ship in
person; the craft they will normally have the most to do with are cruise ships;
interstellar passenger vessels transporting people from habitat to habitat and
visiting the more interesting systems, stars, nebulae, holes and so on in the
locality. Again, this type of tourism is partly long-term fashion; people travel
because they can, not because they have to; they could stay at home and appear
to travel to exotic places through what we would now call Virtual Reality, or
send an information-construct of themselves to a ship or other entity that would
do the experiencing for them, and incorporate the memories themselves later.<p>There have been times, especially just after the relevant VR technology was
perfected, when the amount of real ’physical’ tourism shrank drastically,
whereas during the time the stories are set (apart from during the most intense
phase of the Idiran war), anything up to a tenth of the Culture’s citizens might
be travelling in space at any one time.<p>Planets figure little in the life of the average Culture person; there are a
few handfuls of what are regarded as ’home’ planets, and a few hundred more that
were colonised (sometimes after terraforming) in the early days before the
Culture proper came into being, but only a fraction of a percent of the
Culture’s inhabitants live on them (many more live permanently on ships). More
people live in Rocks; hollowed-out asteroids and planetoids (almost all fitted
with drives, and somea b—c dafter nine millenniaa b—c dhaving been fitted with dozens of
different, consecutively more advanced engines). The majority, however, live in
larger artificial habitats, predominantly Orbitals.<p>Perhaps the easiest way to envisage an Orbital is to compare it to the idea
that inspired it (this sounds better than saying; Here’s where I stole it from).
If you know what a Ringworld isa b—c dinvented by Larry Niven; a segment of a Dyson
Spherea b—c dthen just discard the shadow-squares, shrink the whole thing till it’s
about three million kilometres across, and place in orbit around a suitable
star, tilted just off the ecliptic; spin it to produce one gravity and that
gives you an automatic 24-hour day-night cycle (roughly; the Culture’s day is
actually a bit longer). An elliptical orbit provides seasons.<p>Of course, the materials used in the construction of something ten million
kilometres in circumference spinning once every 24 hours are far beyond anything
we can realistically imagine now, and it is quite possible that the physical
constraints imposed by the strength of atomic bonds ensure that such structures
will prove impossible to construct, but if it is possible to build on a such a
scale and subject such structures to forces of these magnitudes, then I’d submit
that there is an elegance in using the same rotation to produce both an
acceptable day-night cycle and an apparent gravity which makes the idea
intrinsically attractive.<p>Usually, rather than construct whole Orbitals in one operation, the Culture
starts with Plates; a pair of slabs of land and water (plus full retaining
walls, of course) of not less than a thousand kilometres to a side, spinning in
a similar orbit, attached by tensor fields to each other, and behaving like
sections of a completed Orbital; this variation provides greater flexibility
when responding to population increase. Further plate-pairs can then be added
until the Orbital is complete.<p>The attraction of Orbitals is their matter efficiency. For one planet the
size of Earth (population 6 billion at the moment; mass 6x1024 kg), it would be
possible, using the same amount of matter, to build 1,500 full orbitals, each
one boasting a surface area twenty times that of Earth and eventually holding a
maximum population of perhaps 50 billion people (the Culture would regard Earth
at present as over-crowded by a factor of about two, though it would consider
the land-to-water ratio about right). Not, of course, that the Culture would do
anything as delinquent as actually deconstructing a planet to make Orbitals;
simply removing the sort of wandering debris (for example comets and asteroids)
which the average solar system comes equipped with and which would threaten such
an artificial world’s integrity through collision almost always in itself
provides sufficient material for the construction of at least one full Orbital
(a trade-off whose conservatory elegance is almost blissfully appealing to the
average Mind), while interstellar matter in the form of dust clouds, brown
dwarfs and the like provides more distant mining sites from which the amount of
mass required for several complete Orbitals may be removed with negligible
effect.<p>Whatever the source material, Orbitals are obviously far more mass-efficient
in providing living space than planets. The Culture, as is made clear in Use of
Weapons, regards terraforming generally as ecologically unsound; the wilderness
should be left as it is, when it is so easy to build paradise in space from so
little.<p>An idea of how the day-night cycle appears on the surface of an Orbital can
be gained by taking an ordinary belt, buckling it so that it forms a circle, and
putting your eye to the outside of one of the belt’s holes; looking through the
hole at a light bulb and slowly rotating the whole belt will give some idea of
how a star appears to move across the sky when seen from an Orbital, though it
will also leave you looking rather silly.<p>As indicated, the usual minimum for the width of an Orbital is about a
thousand kilometres (two thousand if you count the sloped, mostly transparent
retaining walls, which usually extend to five hundred kilometres or so above the
plate land-sea surface). The normal ratio of land to sea is 1:3, so that on each
Platea b—c dassuming they are being constructed in the balanced pairs described
abovea b—c da (very) roughly square island rests in the middle of a sea, with
approximately two hundred and fifty kilometres from the shore of the land mass
to the retaining walls. Orbitals, though, like everything else in the Culture,
vary enormously.<p>One thing almost every Orbitala b—c dwhether just two Plates or a completed
(“closed”) Orbitala b—c ddoes have, is a Hub. As its name implies, the Hub sits in
the centre of the Orbital, equidistant from all parts of the main
circumferential structure (but not physically joined to it, normally). The Hub
is where the Orbital’s controlling AI (often a Mind) usually exists, running, or
helping to run, the Orbital’s transport, manufacturing, maintenance and
subsidiary systems, acting as switchboard for trans-Orbital communications,
library and general information point, traffic control for approaching,
departing and close-passing ships, and generally working as the Orbital’s
principle link with the rest of the Culture. During the construction phase of a
Plate-pair, the Hub will normally control the process.<p>The design of a Plate sometimes incorporates the deepa b—c dor strategica b—c dstructure of the surface geography, so that the Plate medium itself contains the
corrugations that will become mountains, valleys and lakes; more commonly, the
Plate surface is left flat and the strategic structures on the inner surfacea b—c dalso constructed from Plate base materiala b—c dare added later. Under either
method, the Plate’s manufacturing and maintenance systems are located within the
indentations or hollows of the strategic structure, leaving the land surface
free to assume a rural appearance, once the tactical geomorphology has been
designed and positioned, the Plate’s complement of water and air has been
emplaced, the necessary weathering has occurred, and the relevant flora and
fauna have been introduced.<p>The surface of the Plate base is pierced by multitudinous shafts allowing
access to the factory and maintenance volumes, and to the sub-surface transport
systems. (Almost invariably, these include restricted single-aperture
concentrically rotating airlocks paired in sequence.)<p>Existing on the outer surface of the base material, an Orbital’s
rapid-transport systems operate in vacuum, with the resulting advantages the
lack of air-resistance confers; the relatively uncluttered nature of the
Orbital’s outer surface (whether flat, allowing the systems to operate next to
that surface, or corrugated, requiring sling-bridges under unoccupied mountain
indentations), means that the systems can be both high-capacity and extremely
flexible. Journey starting-points and destinations can be highly specific for
the same reason; an isolated house or a small village will have its own access
shaft, and in larger conurbations a shaft will usually be within a few minutes
walk.<p>Surface transport on Orbitals tends to be used when the pleasure of making
the journey is itself part of the reason for travelling; air travel is common
enough (if still far slower than sub-surface travel), though individual Plates
often have their own guide-lines concerning the amount of air travel thought
appropriate. Such guide-lines are part of one’s manners, and not formalised in
anything as crude as laws.<p>The Culture doesn’t actually have laws; there are, of course, agreed-on forms
of behaviour; manners, as mentioned above, but nothing that we would recognise
as a legal framework. Not being spoken to, not being invited to parties, finding
sarcastic anonymous articles and stories about yourself in the information
network; these are the normal forms of manner-enforcement in the Culture. The
very worst crime (to use our terminology), of course, is murder (defined as
irretrievable brain-death, or total personality loss in the case of an AI). The
resulta b—c dpunishment, if you willa b—c dis the offer of treatment, and what is known
as a slap-drone. All a slap-drone does is follow the murderer around for the
rest of their life to make sure they never murder again. There are less severe
variations on this theme to deal with people who are simply violent.<p>In a society where material scarcity is unknown and the only real value is
sentimental value, there is little motive or opportunity for the sort of action
we would class as a crime against property.<p>Megalomaniacs are not unknown in the Culture, but they tend to be diverted
successfully into highly complicated games; there are entire Orbitals where some
of these philosophically crude Obsessive games are played, though most are in
Virtual Reality. Something of a status-symbol for the determined megalomaniac is
having one’s own starship; this is considered wasteful by most people, and is
also futile, if the purpose of having it is to escape the Culture completely anda b—c dsaya b—c dset up oneself up as God or Emperor on some backward planet; the person
might be free to pilot their (obviously non-AI controlled) ship, and even
approach a planet, but the Contact section is equally free to follow that person
wherever they go and do whatever it thinks appropriate to stop him or her from
doing anything injurious or unpleasant to whatever civilisations they come intoa b—c dor attempt to come intoa b—c dcontact with. This tends to be frustrating, and
Virtual Reality gamesa b—c dup to and including utter-involvement level, in which
the player has to make a real and sustained effort to return to the real world,
and can even forget that it exists entirelya b—c dare far more satisfying.<p>Some people, however, refuse this escape-route too, and leave the Culture
altogether for a civilisation that suits them better and where they can operate
in a system which gives them the kind of rewards they seek. To renounce the
Culture so is to lose access to its technology though, and, again, Contact
supervises the entry of such people into their chosen civilisation at a level
which guarantees they aren’t starting with too great an advantage compared to
the original inhabitants (and retains the option of interfering, if it sees
fit).<p>A few such apparently anti-social people are even used by Contact itself,
especially by the Special Circumstances section.<p>The way the Culture creates AIs means that a small number of them suffer from
similar personality problems; such machines are given the choice of cooperative
re-design, a more limited role in the Culture than they might have had
otherwise, or a similarly constrained exile.<p>Politics in the Culture consists of referenda on issues whenever they are
raised; generally, anyone may propose a ballot on any issue at any time; all
citizens have one vote. Where issues concern some sub-division or part of a
total habitat, all thosea b—c dhuman and machinea b—c dwho may reasonably claim to be
affected by the outcome of a poll may cast a vote. Opinions are expressed and
positions on issues outlined mostly via the information network (freely
available, naturally), and it is here that an individual may exercise the most
personal influence, given that the decisions reached as a result of those votes
are usually implemented and monitored through a Hub or other supervisory
machine, with humans acting (usually on a rota basis) more as liaison officers
than in any sort of decision-making executive capacity; one of the few rules the
Culture adheres to with any exactitude at all is that a person’s access to power
should be in inverse proportion to their desire for it. The sad fact for the
aspiring politico in the Culture is that the levers of power are extremely
widely distributed, and very short (see entry on megalomaniacs, above). The
intellectual-structural cohesion of a starship of course limits the sort of
viable votes possible on such vessels, though as a rule even the most arrogant
craft at least pretend to listen when their guests suggesta b—c dsaya b—c dmaking a
detour to watch a supernova, or increasing the area of parkland on-board.<p>Day-to-day life in the Culture varies considerably from place to place, but
there is a general stability about it we might find either extremely peaceful or
ultimately rather disappointing, depending on our individual temperament. We,
after all, are used to living in times of great change; we expect major
technological developments and have learned to adapta b—c dindeed expect to have to
adapt on a more or less continual basis, changing (in the developed world) our
cars, our entertainment systems and a whole variety of household objects every
few years. In contrast, the Culture builds to last; it is not uncommon for an
aircraft, for example, to be handed down through several generations. Important
technological advances still take place, but they don’t tend to affect
day-to-day life the way that the invention of the internal combustion engine,
heavier-than-air flying machines and electronics have affected the lives of
those who have lived during the past century on Earth. Even the relative
homogeneity of the people one would meet when living on the average Orbitala b—c dwith relatively few children and physically old peoplea b—c dwould tend, for us, to
reinforce the feeling of sameness, though the scattering of genetically altered,
morphologically extreme people around would help compensate for this.<p>In terms of personal relations and family groupings, the Culture is,
predictably, full of every possible permutation and possibility, but the most
common life-style consists of groups of people of mixed generations linked by
loose family ties living in a semi-communal dwelling or group of dwellings; to
be a child in the Culture is to have a mother, perhaps a father, probably not a
brother or sister, but large numbers of aunts and uncles, and various cousins.
Usually, a mother will avoid changing sex during the first few years of a
child’s life. (Though, of course, if you want to confuse your child...) In the
rare event of a parent maltreating a child (a definition which includes
depriving the child of the opportunity for education) it is considered
acceptable for people close to thema b—c dusually with the help of the relevant
Mind, ship or Hub AI, and subject to the sort of small-scale democratic process
outlined abovea b—c dto supervise the child’s subsequent development.<p>In general the Culture doesn’t actively encourage immigration; it looks too
much like a disguised form of colonialism. Contact’s preferred methods are
intended to help other civilisations develop their own potential as a whole, and
are designed to neither leech away their best and brightest, nor turn such
civilisations into miniature versions of the Culture. Individuals, groups and
even whole lesser civilisations do become part of the Culture on occasion,
however, if there seems to be a particularly good reason (and if Contact reckons
it won’t upset any other interested parties in the locality).<p>Just who and what is and isn’t Culture is something of a difficult question
to answer though; as has been said in one of the books, the Culture kind of
fades out at the edges. There are still fragmentsa b—c dmillions of ships, hundreds
of Orbitals, whole systemsa b—c dof the Peace faction of the Culture, which split
from the main section just before the start of the Idiran War, when ships and
habitats voted independently on the need to go to war at all; the minority
simply declared itself neutral in the hostilities and the re-integration of the
Peace faction after the cessation of hostilities was never totally completed,
many people in it preferring to stay outside the majority Culture as long as it
did not renounce the future use of force.<p>The genofixing which established the potential for inter-species breeding at
the foundation of the Culture is the most obvious indicator of what we might
call Culture-hood in humans, but not everybody has it; some people prefer to be
more human-basic for aesthetic or philosophical reasons, while some are so
altered from that human-basic state that any interbreeding is impossible. The
status of some of the Rocks and a few (mostly very old) habitats is marginal for
a variety of reasons.<p>Contact is the most coherent and consistent part of the Culturea b—c dcertainly
when considered on a galactic scalea b—c dyet it is only a very small part of it, is
almost a civilisation within a civilisation, and no more typifies its host than
an armed service does a peaceful state. Even the Cultures’s prized language,
Marain, is not spoken by every Culture person, and is used well outside the
limits of the civilisation itself.<p>Names; Culture names act as an address if the person concerned stays where
they were brought up. Let’s take an example; Balveda, from Consider Phlebas. Her
full name is Juboal-Rabaroansa Perosteck Alseyn Balveda dam T’seif. The first
part tells you she was born/brought up on Rabaroan Plate, in the Juboal stellar
system (where there is only one Orbital in a system, the first part of a name
will often be the name of the Orbital rather than the star); Perosteck is her
given name (almost invariably the choice of one’s mother), Alseyn is her chosen
name (people usually choose their names in their teens, and sometimes have a
succession through their lives; an alseyn is a graceful but fierce avian raptor
common to many Orbitals in the region which includes the Juboal system); Balveda
is her family name (usually one’s mother’s family name) and T’seif is the
house/estate she was raised within. The ’sa’ affix on the first part of her name
would translate into ’er’ in English (we might all start our names with
’Sun-Earther’, in English, if we were to adopt the same nomenclature), and the
’dam’ part is similar to the German ’von’. Of course, not everyone follows this
naming-system, but most do, and the Culture tries to ensure that star and
Orbital names are unique, to avoid confusion.<p>Now, in all the above, there are two untold stories implicit. One is the
history of the Culture’s formation, which was a lot less easy and more troubled
than its later demeanour might lead one to expect, and the other is the story
which answers the question; why were there all those so-similar humanoid species
scattered around the galaxy in the first place?<p>Each story is too complicated to relate here.<p>Lastly, something of the totally fake cosmology that underpins the shakily
credible stardrives mentioned in the Culture stories. Even if you can accept all
the above, featuring a humanoid species that seems to exhibit no real greed,
paranoia, stupidity, fanaticism or bigotry, wait till you read this...<p>We accept that the three dimensions of space we live in are curved, that
space-time describes a hypersphere, just as the two dimensions of length and
width on the surface of a totally smooth planet curve in a third dimension to
produce a three-dimensional sphere. In the Culture stories, the idea is thata b—c dwhen you imagine the hypersphere which is our expanding universea b—c drather than thinking of a growing hollow sphere (like a inflating beach-ball,
for example), think of an onion.<p>An expanding onion, certainly, but an onion, nevertheless. Within our
universe, our hypersphere, there are whole layers of younger, smaller
hyperspheres. And we are not the very outer-most skin of that expanding onion,
either; there are older, larger universes beyond ours, too. Between each
universe there is something called the Energy Grid (I said this was all fake); I
have no idea what this is, but it’s what the Culture starships run on. And of
course, if you could get through the Energy Grid, to a younger universe, and
then repeat the process... now we really are talking about immortality. (This is
why there are two types of hyperspace mentioned in the stories; infraspace
within our hypersphere, and ultraspace without.)<p>Now comes the difficult bit; switch to seven dimensions and even our four
dimensional universe can be described as a circle. So forget about the onion;
think of a doughnut. A doughnut with only a very tiny hole in the middle. That
hole is the Cosmic Centre, the singularity, the great initiating fireball, the
place the universes come from; and it didn’t exist just in the instant our
universe came into being; it exists all the time, and it’s exploding all the
time, like some Cosmic car engine, producing universes like exhaust smoke.<p>As each universe comes into being, detonating and spreading and expanding, ita b—c dor rather the single circle we are using to describe ita b—c dgoes gradually up
the inner slope of our doughnut, like a widening ripple from a stone flung in a
pond. It goes over the top of the doughnut, reaches its furthest extent on the
outside edge of the doughnut, and then starts the long, contracting, collapsing
journey back in towards the Cosmic Centre again, to be reborn...<p>Or at least it does if it’s on that doughnut; the doughnut is itself hollow,
filled with smaller ones where the universes don’t live so long. And there are
larger ones outside it, where the universes live longer, and maybe there are
universes that aren’t on doughnuts at all, and never fall back in, and just
dissipate out into... some form of meta-space? Where fragments of them are
captured eventually by the attraction of another doughnut, and fall in towards
its Cosmic Centre with the debris of lots of other dissipated universes, to be
reborn as something quite different again? Who knows. (I know it’s all nonsense,
but you’ve got to admit it’s impressive nonsense. And like I said at the start,
none of it exists anyway, does it?)<p>Anyway, that’s more than enough of me pontificating.<p>With best wishes for the future,<p><b>Iain M Banks</b><br>(Sun-Earther Iain El-Bonko Banks of North
