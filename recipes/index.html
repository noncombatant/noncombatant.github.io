easy to scale them up —  just multiply by how many servings you want.<p>I like really spicy food, so you might want to be a bit careful. Taste as you
go.<p>I was raised by a legitimately good cook, but I don’t have the talent, so
these recipes are all radically simple and easy. Get decent ingredients,
spending most of your money on good quality protein and dairy, and you’ll be
good to go.<div id=toc></div><a id=mustard-vinaigrette></a><h2>Mustard Vinaigrette</h2><ul><li><span class=quant>2 tbsp</span> sherry vinegar<li><span class=quant>0.5 tbsp</span> minced shallot<li><span class=quant>0.5 tbsp</span> Dijon mustard<li><span class=quant>0.33 cup</span> EV olive oil<li><span class=quant>1 tbsp</span> herbs, finely chopped<li>salt<li>pepper</ul><p>Blend smoothly in a small bowl. Season lightly to taste.<h2>Butter Lettuce Salad</h2><ul><li>mustard vinaigrette<li>1 head butter lettuce<li><span class=quant>4 oz</span> dates, chopped<li><span class=quant>4 oz</span> almonds or other nuts, chopped<li><span class=quant>2 oz</span> of a small red onion, thinly sliced</ul><h3>Prep</h3><p>Chop the dates and almonds into small bite-lets, and set aside.<p>Slice the onions into very thin (less than 1 mm) slices. Cut them in half,
then break apart the rings.<p>Cut off the root of the lettuce, if any. Peel off any wilted or dead outer
leaves of the lettuce.<h3>Doin’ It</h3><p>Layer by layer, gently peel off the leaves of the lettuce. Cut the larger
ones in half. Blend dates, nuts, onions, and lettuce in a salad bowl. Serve with
vinaigrette on the side in a carafe.<h3>Options</h3><p>You can replace the onions with any other fresh, crispy vegetable.<p>Add cheese! Brie or Humboldt Fog are good options.</p><a id=scrambled-eggs-pancetta></a><h2>Scrambled Eggs With Pancetta</h2><ul><li>1 green onion<li><span class=quant>1.5 oz</span> pancetta, cubed<li>2 eggs<li><span class=quant>1 tbsp</span> whole milk<li><span class=quant>1 tsp</span> olive oil<li>pepper</ul><h3>Prep</h3><p>Fry the pancetta in a pan, drain it on a paper towel, and set it aside.<p>While the pancetta is frying, chop the white part of the onion into 1 mm
slices, then chop the greens diagonally into 1 cm lengths. Set aside.<p>Crack 2 eggs in a bowl, add the milk and pepper to taste, and gently whisk
just enough to get it evenly mixed.<h3>Doin’ It</h3><p>Raise a pan to lower-medium heat. Pour in oil. Once the oil is warm, put in
the whites of the onions. When they’ve reached a light color (not brown!), put
in the greens for a minute. Keep everything moving with a soft spatula the whole
time.<p>Slowly pour in the eggs. Keep them moving. As the eggs start to form, blend
in the pancetta. If the eggs form too fast, dial the heat down —  do not let them
brown in the pan. Slow is better than toasted (nasty)!<h3>Options</h3><p>Non-meat: Replace the pancetta with sliced mushrooms, lightly fried in olive
oil and butter.<p>Spicy: Warm up a pinch of red pepper flakes in the oil before adding the
onion whites.</p><a id=garlic-bread></a><h2>Cook’s Classic American Garlic Bread</h2><p>Lord Chompington approves.<ul><li>9 – 10 medium cloves garlic (about the size of a plump cashew nut), skins
