draft than in the post as finally published.</aside><div id=toc></div><p><i>Recoverability</i> is my word for a desirable computer safety property:
The ability to fully assert ownership and control over the machine and all its
operations. (This includes the ability to fully <i>relinquish</i> control of the
machine, too.)<p>Recoverability is crucial in many everyday situations:<ul><li>When the machine changes ownership (new and used purchases, gifts, loaner
machines from the help desk, et c.).<li>When decommissioning the machine, you want to ensure that the machine is
entirely clean of your data — including sensitive documents and files, but also
access tokens and credentials.<li>When borrowing the computer (from a friend, at the copy shop, at the public
library, et c.).<li>After an attacker has compromised the machine.<li>When people (e.g. family members, roommates) share a computer or phone.
(This scenario can involve hostility, e.g. intimate partner surveillance and
abuse. We have to adopt and work to solve for this threat model!)</ul><p>You can see that recoverability really is an everyday problem, for everyone,
when you consider how many kinds of devices require recoverability. A
sampling:<ul><li>traditional computers: servers, desktops, laptops<li>phones<li>kiosk and point-of-sale computers<li>printers, scanners, fax machines<li>cars (<a href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/30/car-renters-beware-bluetooth-use-can-reveal-your-private-data/1080225001/>ever
found someone else’s contacts in your rental?</a>)<li>Alexas, Google Homes, Apple HomePods, et c.<li>most kinds of data storage devices (USB drives, SSDs, spinning disks, et
c.)</ul><p>Recoverability is mostly about code integrity, but maintaining data
confidentiality (usually by ensuring it’s destroyed) is also important.<h2>Our Goal</h2><p>Our goal should be to make recoverability and relinquishment first-class,
well-supported, documented, discoverable <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/399.pdf>ceremonies</a> that people
can
easily and regularly use. For example, <a href=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208244>resetting a digital
assistant</a> really should delete all user data storage, and should
affirmatively reset all system software (including all peripheral firmware!) to
a known-good state.<p>Of course, that’s harder than it sounds. If your SSD’s firmware is
compromised, it’s probably lying to you about updating the operating system and
the firmware itself.<h2>The Problem</h2><p>In most computing devices, there are tons of places where no-longer-wanted
data and code can remain, thwarting our ability to recover the device. <a href=https://www.malwaretech.com/2015/06/hard-disk-firmware-rootkit-surviving.html>Malware
might hide in the firmware</a>. (Many peripherals, including <a href=https://mobile.twitter.com/Foone/status/1161421430178766853>keyboards</a>,
network interfaces, storage devices, cameras, <a href=https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13454052/apple-macbook-pro-touch-bar-apple-watch-features>the
Mac Touchbar</a>, and more have updatable firmware.) <a href=https://securitywatch.pcmag.com/privacy/320343-how-to-securely-dispose-of-a-printer>Many
printers and scanners keep a copy of what they’ve printed and scanned</a> — how
do you wipe your tax records off your printer before selling it on Craigslist?
And so on.<h2>‘Easy’ Solutions</h2><p>It might seem that we could ease recoverability by designing the system such
that it is essentially <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%5EX>W^X</a> —  writable data can never become executable code. However, it is very close to
impossible to achieve this for a variety of reasons. Among others:<ul><li>The system might <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language>interpret data as
code</a> (this includes configuration files). This is so useful that system
designers can’t help themselves, or even don’t realize they’re doing it.<li>It means giving up updatability. Is that even worse for safety than poor
recoverability?</ul><p>Perhaps the only real way to achieve W^X is on a pure-ROM system: no writes.
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System>As great
as the NES was</a>, a system designed on that principle has very limited
utility. (But more than none! And maybe sufficient for some of the use-cases?)
Although <a href=https://www.dkoldies.com/blog/-complete-list-of-nintendo-nes-games-with-save-batteries/>NES
Game Paks eventually got writable RAM</a>, it was <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_memory>volatile</a> and hence
recoverable.<p>That suggests another option: volatile installation. Even if the code is
writable, as long as the memory is exclusively volatile, the device is
recoverable. For example, <a href=https://panic.com/blog/the-lightning-digital-av-adapter-surprise/>Apple
Lightning cables work this way</a>. (More fun from <a href=https://twitter.com/nyan_satan/status/1155148789977636864>Lisa
Braun</a>.) <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microcode>CPU
microcode updates can work the same way</a>.<p>We can also achieve a certain degree of recoverability if there are code
updates, including in non-volatile memory, but all updates are authenticated
(such as by cryptographic code and keys from ROM or a TPM). This gives us a good
degree of recoverability until the non-updatable <a href=https://www.macrumors.com/2013/06/24/apples-ios-7-lightning-connector-authentication-check-permanently-cracked/>crypto
is cracked</a>. (See also <a href=https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/2019-01/USB-IF_USB%20Type-C%20Authentication%20Program%20Press%20Release_FINAL_20181227.pdf>USB-C
authentication</a>.)<p>For data confidentiality —  mainly, rendering data unusable upon
relinquishment —  the only real way is to always write only ciphertext into
non-volatile memory, then to destroy the key when relinquishing. Modern storage
technology does not give us a way to be sure that data is deleted. (See e.g. <a href=https://www.ontrack.com/blog/2016/10/25/wear-leveling/>wear-leveling</a>.)
We can only hope to make it indecipherable.<figure><img src=ios-security-effaceable.png width=436 height=290 alt="Screenshot of Apple iOS Security Guide: “The Erase All Content and Settings
option in Settings obliterates all of the keys in Effaceable Storage, rendering
all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible. Therefore, it’s an
ideal way to be sure all personal information is removed from a device before
giving it to somebody else or returning it for service.”" loading=lazy><figcaption>Effaceable memory for keys, described in the <a href=https://www.apple.com/business/docs/site/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf>iOS
Security Guide</a> as a recoverability mechanism.</figcaption></figure><p>But all these ‘easy’ mechanisms leave us with a question: do we have to trade
off updatability for recoverability? Even volatile installation depends on the
integrity of the installation source (usually your primary operating
system).<h2>The Hardest Case: Compromise</h2><p>What are you actually, really supposed to do to recover your computer after
it has been compromised?<p>Recovering and re-verifying the integrity of all your data and network
accounts could be the topic of several books. For this post, I just mean the
computer itself. After a successful attack, is your computer merely <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste#Amount_of_electronic_waste_worldwide>e-waste</a>?<p>Unfortunately, <b>all</b> your software and forgotten firmware is potentially
relevant attack surface but also a potential persistence mechanism —  breaking
recoverability. We have to assume the worst in case of actual compromise. But
depending on the hardware and firmware design, we may not have a way to recover
all the firmwares. This includes those in the storage devices, which can break
our ability even to recover the primary OS.<p>Thus recoverability is an unsolved privacy, usability, economic, and even
environmental problem. It’s a fun and important problem for these reasons and
(especially to me) because solving it requires a holistic, general view of
computer systems. It’ll never be enough to ‘just’ design a good update protocol,
or kernel, or UX, or memory subsystem. All those pieces (and more) must fit
together in a coherent narrative and ceremony that people can observe, believe,
and rely on every day.<hr><aside><p>Mara Tam reminded me in conversation that the shared device use case
demonstrates a particularly acute need for recoverability and relinquishment.
Any other errors or omissions are mine, of course.<p>Someday I’d like to write at greater length about this use case. My
colleagues and I have spent significant time chewing on it, and although it’s
not easy it’s crucial that all platform developers handle it. Not only is it
possible to do more than nothing, there may be some relatively straightforward
improvements to be made.</aside><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
