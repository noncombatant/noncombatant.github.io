design and development over the past year, and to try to find a meaningful way
forward for myself for 2019. My perspective is limited by the fact that I have
worked exclusively in client-side software security for the past 7.5 years.
Still, I think there are broad trends visible even to me, and some clear signs
about where we need to go as an industry.<p>I hope that this post is useful to a variety of security people: not just
engineers, but also UX designers and researchers, project/product/program
managers, people and business managers, and operations. In any case, all paths
to success require the help of all those kinds of people. This post is even more
of a link-fest than usual; I hope that‚Äôs useful.<p>The high-order bit in much of the below is complexity. Hardware, software,
platforms, and ecosystems are often way too complex, and a whole lot of our
security, privacy, and abuse problems stem from that.<h2>The Good</h2><p><a href=https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/1072199572628299776>Encrypting
the web is going swimmingly</a>! Also, <a href=https://blog.chromium.org/2018/05/evolving-chromes-security-indicators.html>marking
non-secure web origins as non-secure, and marking secure origins as neutral</a>,
is moving right along. It‚Äôs amazing and wonderful that we‚Äôve improved so much so
quickly, and it gives me hope for other huge efforts (see below). Thanks as
always to <a href=https://letsencrypt.org/donate/>Let‚Äôs Encrypt</a>, and to
the other browsers who are moving in a similar direction!<p>Although <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_corruption>memory
corruption</a> vulnerabilities remain prevalent, iOS, Chrome OS, and Chrome are
existence proofs that, with good effort in design (privilege reduction) and
unreasonably high effort in implementation (actually making privilege reduction
work, <a href=https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/docs/clusterfuzz.md>bug
hunting</a>, bug fixing, and rapid deployment of bug fixes), it is <strong>just
barely</strong> possible to significantly raise the cost of exploiting memory
corruption vulnerabilities for projects implemented in unsafe languages. Against
modern targets, exploiting memory corruption is nowhere near as easy as it was
in the 1990s or the 2000s.<p><a href=https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/19/ios-11-adoption-65-percent/>iOS
continues to have excellent update adoption</a> (<a href=https://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/>see also</a>), even though it‚Äôs
voluntaryax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†a sign that people perceive the value of the updates. It‚Äôs unlikely
people are making their choice on the basis of security per se, of course. But
<a href=https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/1081384425416470528>security and
privacy are key parts of iOS‚Äô value proposition</a>, and I do think at least
some customers perceive them.<p><a href=https://blog.github.com/2018-11-15-state-of-the-octoverse-top-programming-languages/>Memory-safe
programming languages dominate the landscape</a>. Additionally, the
fastest-growing languages are memory-safe. Some popular languages are even
type-safe. (Some might consider type safety a mere bonus, but to me, <a href=http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/TypefulProg.pdf>typefulness</a> is a
crucial building block for reliable and safe software.) There is even good news
in systems software, previously the unchallenged and most undeserved domain of
unsafety: Go is big there, and Rust is boopin‚Äô right along (see e.g. <a href=https://servo.org/>Servo</a>, <a href=https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/>CrOS
VM</a>, <a href=https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor>the Xi editor</a>, <a href=https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/docs/+/d4f9b980f18fc6722b06abb693240b29abbbc9fc/rust_quickstart.md>parts
of Fuchsia</a>). Although we mourn <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_(operating_system)>Midori</a>, it
can still teach us <a href=http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/>broadly
applicable, deep lessons</a>. (See especially <a href=http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/a-tale-of-three-safeties/>A Tale Of
Three Safeties</a> and <a href=http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/>The Error
Model</a>.)<p>Memory tagging, a new (and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_architecture>old</a>) feature of
hardware, can help with memory safety problems. <a href=https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-10/slides/Serebryany-Stepanov-Tsyrklevich-Memory-Tagging-Slides-LLVM-2018.pdf>People
are working on making it happen on modern systems</a> (<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09517.pdf>paper</a>). I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a
replacement for fixing bugs in as systemic a way as possible (ideally, in the
source language), but it has great potential to increase safety.<p>Static checkersax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†compilersax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääydand dynamic checkers (e.g. <a href=https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>Address Sanitizer</a>
and the rest of the LLVM sanitizers) have advanced very far in the past 20
years. What was once bleeding-edge research now comes for free with
off-the-shelf compilers. This is fantastic! (Start with <code>-Wall
-Werror</code> in Clang or GCC, but I like to use <code>-Weverything
-Werror</code>, with a few exceptions like <code>-Wno-padded</code>.
Really.)<p><a href=https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/trustworthy-chrome-extensions-by-default.html>Chrome
is making some structural improvements to the extensions platform</a>, which
should reduce <a href=https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-extension-malware/>some of the worst
abuses we see in that ecosystem</a>.<p>Parts of the software industry are having <a href=https://www.amazon.com/World-Technology-Massey-Lectures-Revised/dp/088784636X>an

Must Drop Dragonfly</a></ul><p>You don‚Äôt have to agree with all those positions to find it good news that
our generation of engineers is growing beyond the ‚ÄúI could build it, so I did;
what are consequences?‚Äù mentality. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Professionals_for_Social_Responsibility>Previous
generations had to make very similar choices</a>.<p>(I do happen to agree with all those positions, and I will not work on
machines designed for war or police, nor on Big Brotherly, censored search
engines. And I support the efforts for equality and fair treatment for everyone.
The Walkout was a good day, but it was just a beginning. There‚Äôs a long way to
go.)<p>The increasing awareness and adoption of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor>Universal 2nd Factor
authentication</a> is great news. (U2F has been standardized as <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/>WebAuthn</a>, which is considerably more
complex than most security people would like. Expect bugs to come of that...)
The high degree of phishing resistance it offers is at least as important as the
protections HTTPS provides. Phishing and account take-over have consistently
been 1 of our biggest problems, and WebAuthn can put a big dent in them. You can
use it now with Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, login.gov, and others.<h2>The Bad</h2><p>C++ continues to be untenably complex and wildly unsafe:<ul><li><a href=http://www.stroustrup.com/P0977-remember-the-vasa.pdf>C++‚Äôs
creator finds himself on the other side of the community</a> on the issue of
C++‚Äôs growing complexity. Stroustrup correctly identifies C++‚Äôs growing
complexity as a potentially fatal risk for the language.<li><a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34729">The new, safe APIs are
not safe</a>. (‚ÄúWONTFIX‚Äù.)<li><a href=https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213>C and C++ compilers continue
to exploit undefined behavior</a>ax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†something that should not existax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†for the
dubious goal of micro-optimizations. (John Regehr: ‚ÄúA compiler that is very
smart at recognizing and silently destroying Type 3 functions becomes
effectively evil, from the developer‚Äôs point of view.‚Äù)<li>C++ is so complicated that <a href=https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/cxx/2UTgWpM5N0c>expert
programmers cannot find a universal way to find the size of a static array</a>,
other than the classic vanilla C macro. Maybe simple is good, after all? ü§î</ul><p>I can‚Äôt possibly select and link to a list of the infinite bug reports whose
root causes are memory unsafety. A fun exercise is to skim through a good source
of vulnerability write-ups (<a href=https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/>the Project Zero blog</a> is one
of my favorites), and count how many of the bugs are even in the application
domain at all.<p>(Of course, if you find that there are more memory safety bugs than
application-domain bugs or other bugs, that could just as well be due to the
researchers‚Äô biases. But I think we can all agree that memory corruption bugs
simply should not exist at all, yet are numerous and often exploitable.)<p>Designing a language that achieves all of memory safety, high performance,
and good usability remains very hard. The Rust compiler notices and rejects
safety bugs that C and C++ compilers don‚Äôt notice/can‚Äôt notice/purposefully
accept. ü§™üî® That is to Rust‚Äôs credit, but <a href=https://rcoh.me/posts/rust-linked-list-basically-impossible/>this
discipline can be extremely difficult to learn</a>.<p>Among the programming language research community‚Äôs goals is proving programs
safe. Gradually and increasingly, that work trickles down into real languages
that people can really use to ship real software. <a href=https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/09/07/provers.html>The difficulty of
using academic tools</a> is partly a natural consequence of their small
audience, but some of the difficulty is unavoidable: proof of safety means
<strong>proof</strong>, that difficult thing that people get PhDs for.
Ultimately, the software engineering community is going to have to commit to
meeting this standard, gradually and increasingly.<p>Obviously, 2018 was the year everyone became aware of <a href=https://meltdownattack.com/>Spectre & Meltdown</a>, <a href=https://foreshadowattack.eu/>Foreshadow</a>, <a href=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/l1tf.html>L1TF</a>,
and the idea of micro-architectural <a href=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2209/42809262c17b6631c0f6536c91aaf7756857.pdf>side-channels
generally</a>. Shared resources abound, unfortunately. Of course, other
show-stopper security problems (typically due to <a href=https://people.kth.se/~maguire/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100402-Vassilios_Ververis-with-cover.pdf>monstrous
complexity</a>) have been known for a long time (<a href=https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/archive/fr/sciences/fichiers/lti/cansecwest2006-duflot.pdf>see
also</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Mode#Problems>see
also</a>). Although those links refer mostly to Intel Architecture systems,
there‚Äôs no reason to think that (e.g.) ARM is inherently safer. In particular,
the micro-architectural side-channel problems are the natural result of
designing for maximum performanceax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†which almost every chip designer is trying
to do, because that‚Äôs what almost every customer wants.<h2>The Ugly</h2><p>Abuse (the malicious use of legitimate functionality) affects more people‚Äôs
lives in more ways than does the exploitation of bugs. Although hacking can have
a surprising influence, such as in the form of political fallout or mass data
breaches, the reasons your friends and family are sad are much more prosaicax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†and harder to solve:<ul><li>Phone scams; <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support_scam>tech-support

hardware, or bundled with marginalware.)<li>The scourge of <a href=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/53vm7n/inside-stalkerware-surveillance-market-flexispy-retina-x>spouseware

üòë. The coming decades are going to bring increasing climate, uh, ‚Äòchallenges‚Äô,
and all computing systems are going to have to prove their worth relative to the
sum of <strong>all</strong> their costsax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†including carbon and e-waste. We won‚Äôt
be able to laugh those off as externalities any longer. Proof-of-work systems
will continue to be unable to show sufficient value for the cost, and may even
be the wedge for regulation (if they don‚Äôt starve themselves or crash
first).<p><a href=https://infrequently.org/2018/09/the-developer-experience-bait-and-switch/>The
web performance crisis</a> (see also <a href=https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm>a hotter take</a> ü•µ) is a
similar situation: hugely wasteful, but not (yet...?) self-limiting. In the past
I‚Äôve had to argue that <a href=https://conferences.oreilly.com/web2expo/webexsf2009/public/schedule/speaker/1016>security
is affordable</a> even given performance constraints. It was possible to get
both performance and security then, by reducing obvious bloat and enabling
less-obvious optimizations, and it‚Äôs possible now. The root cause then was the
same as it is now: too many developers don‚Äôt use the same client systems as
their userbase does, and they don‚Äôt know what network, memory, and CPU costs
they are incurring. Previously, those costs were hard to see. Now, they are
definitely not: every browser has a very good Dev Tools console, and there is no
excuse for not using it.<p>Dependency slurping systems like NPM, CPAN, <code>go get</code>, and so on
continue to freak me out. They might potentially be more dangerous than manual
dependency management, despite the huge risks of that practice, precisely
because they make it ‚Äòeasy‚Äô to grow your project‚Äôs dependency graphax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†and hence
the number of individuals and organizations that you implicitly trust. (And <a href=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/>their
trustworthiness can suddenly change for the worse</a>.) When there are
significant gaps in a language‚Äôs standard library, third-party developers will
eagerly fill those gaps with new dependencies for you to (not always knowingly)
inherit. There is <a href=https://github.com/tc39/proposal-javascript-standard-library/issues/19>an
effort underway to fill gaps in JavaScript‚Äôs standard library</a>, which I
strongly support for this reason.<p>Social media continues to amplify the worst in people, and <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html>some
executives of social media companies continue to be part of the problem</a>.
Dealing with the toxicity and abuse of social media is a long-term,
multi-pronged effort, but 1 thing that we can immediately do as engineers, PMs,
designers, and managers is to push back on ‚Äòengagement‚Äô as the primary or only
metric for ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô. It‚Äôs game-able and heavily gamed, and does not remotely
capture the real experiences of real people on social media. People‚Äôs
experiences are often <a href=http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-point/>profoundly
awful</a>, and we as software developers are responsible for dealing with the
consequences of what we‚Äôve built. Are we empowering people to learn and grow, or
are we amplifying the fuckery of Nazis and Chekists? Clinging to <a href=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/04/platform-censorship-wont-fix-internet>a
simplistic view of free speech</a> is not going to get us out of having to
answer that question.<h2>The Future</h2><p>Unfortunately for me, I want to work on all of these problems. I had a good
fun time in 2018 working on defense at a low-level (<a href=/2018/07/19/application-principals/>just one of many adventures</a>), and
there‚Äôs still plenty of work to be done there. (There‚Äôs lots of ambient
privilege still crying out to be reduced!) It has been rewarding to play my
small part in helping get HTTPS where it needs to be.<p>And unfortunately, the problems that I find the most vexingax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†the abuse
category generallyax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd¬†are not in my area of greatest expertise. My heart is
really in the language problem: meaningful interfaces, ergonomic and safe
libraries, memory safety, and type safety. But it‚Äôs the abuse that makes my
heart sick.<p>Still, I see people really shipping software improvements that seemed
impossible 20 or 10 or 5 years ago. We really are making progress. Here‚Äôs what I
want to see in 2019:<ul><li>Throwing away the idea of using ‚Äòengagement‚Äô as the sole or primary
metric.<li>Socializing policy thinking in the engineering community. It‚Äôs time to put
on our grown-up clothes. The stuff we do matters (otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt do it,
right?), and that means we need to think about and deal with the
consequences.<li>Affordances to improve web performance across the board: a larger JavaScript
standard library; performance improvements in frameworks; improvements in
tooling; client-side interventions and budgets.<li>Eroding the idea that memory-unsafety is acceptable, and shipping more
software in safe languages that would previously have been written in an unsafe
language. This includes not so much straight-up rewrites of existing
applications (<a href=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/>which
Joel says is bad</a>); mostly, I see piecemeal, in-place rewrites of components
(like Servo), and also new applications in well-established categories (like Xi
and CrosVM). New applications also give us a chance to re-think old designs, as
Xi notably does (with its cross-platform, client/server, multiple-front-end
design).<li>Socializing the value of simplicity, and throwing away complexity, at all
levels: UX, languages, libraries, frameworks. In particular, nobody should start
a new project in C++.</ul><p>Smart people are already hard at work on all these things! We can get the
industry closer to where it needs to be, and serve people better. Tomorrow is
Monday...<aside><p>Thanks to Alex Gaynor, Emily Schechter, Emily Stark, Eric Mill, Kate
