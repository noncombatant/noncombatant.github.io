called the <em>relying party</em>, RP) should trust itself to validate an input.
Typically, the callee has a higher degree of privilege than the caller, and will
use its privilege to perform some task for the caller if and only if the input
is valid.<p>Allowing the caller to assert that an input is valid is unsafe: <em>of
course</em> a malicious caller will claim the input is valid. A classic example
of this mistake is when a web server trusts client-side validation in
JavaScript.<h2>The Problem</h2><p>However, input validation functions are attack surface. Validating inputs is
dangerous, and difficult to do correctly. This is especially true when the input
language is complex or when the validator is implemented in an unsafe language.
Validators can suffer from a variety of bug classes:<dl><dt><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety>Memory
unsafety</a>.<dd><p>In a memory-unsafe language, it‚Äôs too easy to write a validation function
that suffers from memory corruption bugs, such as out-of-bounds reads and
writes, and use-after-free. This is especially likely if the input language is
complex, but even simple input languages can be hard to process correctly in
primitive languages.<dt><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety>Type unsafety</a>.<dd><p>In a type-unsafe language, it can be easy to write a validation function
that confuses either the types of input objects or of intermediate types
particular to the function‚Äôs implementation. Attackers can often exploit such
type confusion (often, but not only, by turning it into memory
corruption).<dt>Semantic unsafety and application logic bugs.<dd><p>Some input languages are not necessarily a good match for their problem
domain. They may be overpowered, underpowered, or have a poor mapping to
concepts in the application domain.<p>Other input languages have semantics that don‚Äôt quite match those of the
validating function‚Äôs environment, or are underspecified. For example, <a href=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf>the
JSON ‚Äògrammar‚Äô</a> allows for arbitrarily-long sequences of digits in numeric
value literals, but the JavaScript language uses fixed-size, 64-bit IEEE
floating point values to represent numbers. JavaScript can correctly represent
<a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isSafeInteger>only
53-bit integers</a>.</dl><h3>The Paradox Of Validation</h3><p>If the input language is sufficiently complex‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>which is all too likely in the real
world</a>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†it might be impossible to write a safe validator. In this case, we
have a paradox: the RP can only trust itself to validate its inputs, but cannot
safely do so. For example, consider a web server that needs to validate XML
inputs, or <a href=http://www.c7zero.info/stuff/ASN1_parsing_issues_in_crypto_Latincrypt2015.pdf>applications
that handle ASN.1</a>.<h2>What Could Go Wrong?</h2><p>There are (at least) 2 different kinds of complexity that create (at least) 2
different kinds of potential problems during input validation.<dl><dt>Grammatical complexity, and subsequent semantic complexity.<dd><p>Part of the language-theoretic security goal is to have inputs come from
languages low on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy>Chomsky hierarchy</a>.
This reduces the complexity of validators for such inputs, which increases the
likelihood that they will be correct.<p>Even if the validator is not compromised or exploited during validation,
there is still the problem of correct semantic interpretation. Complex languages
are harder to interpret correctly, giving rise to the problem that the RP might
misinterpret a correct and correctly-validated input.<dt>Side-effect complexity.<dd><p>There is also a question as to the complexity of side-effects that an
input language is designed to cause on the operating environment when
interpreted. Side-effect complexity is orthogonal to grammatical complexity;
even a trivial input language can be used to cause unsafe or undesired
side-effects. For example, consider a shell command validator (perhaps as part
of a system status monitoring web application):<pre>
def is_valid_command(command):
  return re.match(r"^\w+$", command)

def run_command(command):
  if not is_valid_command(command):
    raise ValueError("Nice try, goofball")
  os.system(command)
</pre><p>Although the validator is trivially correct (assuming a design calling for
single-word commands with no parameters or shell syntactic metacharacters), and
is invoked correctly, the above code is unsafe. The triviality of the grammar
does lend itself to further validation though, which is another reason to prefer
simpler grammars.<p>A tighter validator can help us sleep a little easier:<pre>
AllowedCommands = set(("uptime", "dmesg", "netstat"))

def is_valid_command(command):
  return command in AllowedCommands
</pre><p>(Presumably, the designers of the application have accepted the risks of
exposing the outputs of those commands to callers, presumably authenticated and
authorized somehow.)</dl><h3>What About Sandboxing?</h3><p>What do we gain if the RP delegates validation to a privilege-reduced
validator (PRV; e.g. a sandboxed parser), and then trusts the PRV‚Äôs result? If
the PRV was compromised during validation, its result is no more trustworthy
than without sandboxing. But at least the RP would not itself have been
compromised.<p>Sandboxing can reduce the range of potential side-effects that the validator
can perform, ensuring that only intended side-effects take place (if any), even
if the validator is compromised.<p>Sandboxing does nothing for grammatical or semantic complexity, however, and
does not reduce the risks of later misinterpretation.<h3>What About Pre-processing?</h3><p>You might also imagine that we can transform an input into a less complex or
dangerous form: either a normalized or minimized form of the original input
language, or a different, simpler language. I‚Äôll call this <em>downward
transformation</em>, but it might have a more official name (please email me if
you know it!).<p>Downward transformation can be lossless or lossy. (It might seem that
downward transformation would be inherently lossy, but recall that input
languages are sometimes overly powerful. It may be possible to downwardly
transform such a language without semantic loss.)<p>Lossy transformation can carry its own application-semantic risks. For
example, consider transforming XML into JSON: XML has the concept of a document
type definition (DTD), enabling XML parsers to enforce structural invariants of
an XML input. After a pre-processor has transformed the document to JSON, the
recipient of the JSON input would have to re-encode the assertions encoded in
the DTD, with attendant risks of semantic skew and divergence over time.<p>Although potentially useful, downward transformation is not a reduction in
overall system complexity. In fact, it‚Äôs an increase: the system must now be
able to handle 2 languages, not just 1. But it can be possible to separate the
processing of the 2 languages, including sandboxing 1 or both.<h2>Approaching Solutions</h2><dl><dt>Implement validators in memory-safe languages.<dd><p>At a minimum, we can and must eliminate the most rinky-dink vulnerability
class: memory corruption.<dt>Implement validators in type-safe languages.<dd><p>When it‚Äôs trustworthy, we can use the language‚Äôs type system to enforce
grammatical and semantic correctness, for example by encoding each syntactic
structure as a distinct type, with assertions about child structures and their
types. <a href=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_135303.pdf>Proofs
for free!</a><dt>Accept only well-specified languages.<dd><p>Unfortunately, this is easier said than done, both because it‚Äôs hard to
specify a language, and because a few people are still using JSON. Still, we can
sometimes tighten the effective definitions of poor languages that we are forced
to accept, by defining subsets and dialects and by writing them into the API
definition. (E.g., for a JSON validator: ‚ÄúThis function will throw
<code>RangeException</code> for integers not in the range‚Ää‚Äì‚Ää(2<sup>53</sup>‚Ää‚Äì‚Ää1)
.. 2<sup>53</sup>‚Ää‚Äì‚Ää¬†1, inclusive.‚Äù)<dt>Sandbox to constrain side-effects.<dd><p>This is ‚Äòobvious‚Äô, but it‚Äôs <a href=https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2017/05/bleed-continues-18-byte-file-14k-bounty.html>not
done nearly as often as it should be</a>. <a href=https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/minijail/>Minijail is
a good sandboxing option for Linux</a>. There is also <a href=https://github.com/google/nsjail>NsJail</a>.<dt>Cross-implementation unit and integration tests.<dd><p>My favorite example is <a href=http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php>Nicolas Seriot‚Äôs JSON torture
test/freak show</a>.</dl><h3>Benefits Of Safety And Simplicity</h3><p>A memory-safe implementation of a validator for a language with no
side-effects on the environment (e.g. no shell command intepreter) would allow
us to, potentially, skip sandboxing. This is valuable because, outside of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(operating_system)>a type-safe
virtual machine</a>, the fundamental sandboxing primitive is the OS‚Äô process
boundary. It can be surprisingly expensive, in both time and space, to create
new processes. The problem gets worse at a high degree of granularity (e.g. a
fresh sandbox per input, or even potentially 2 for downward transformation) and
especially with requirements for high throughput (many inputs) and/or low
latency.<p>From a systems perspective, it‚Äôs reasonable to question if
unsafe-but-efficient languages are in fact efficient.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is
