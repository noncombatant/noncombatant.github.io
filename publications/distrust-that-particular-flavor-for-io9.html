<!doctype html><meta charset=utf-8><p>Review of <em>Distrust That Particular Flavor</em> for io9 by Chris
Palmer<p>William Gibson is, as was the great Octavia Butler, one of the finest
science fiction authors because he knows that people are the strangest
products science has ever produced. So I was very excited to get my hands on
<em>Distrust That Particular Flavor</em>, because I wanted to find out how
he came to know that so well, when so many other sci-fi authors struggle to
see it. And <em>Distrust</em> does not disappoint: Gibson completists will
definitely need the book, but I also recommend it was a way for those new to
Gibson to get a grip on where he’s coming from.<p>Fans of Gibson’s voice will recognize in his non-fiction the luminous,
open-ended sound of his novels. Part of that sound comes from the nature of
his ideas; the rest, from his skill in bringing the dream-state of our
culture to us in lucid yet elusive prose. Consider atemporality, a central
theme in his novels. Atemporality has always been the condition of human
culture but has, paradoxically, only recently become immediately accessible
to everyone, as he notes in “Dead Man Sings”, one of the richest articles in
<em>Distrust</em>.<blockquote><p>Time moves in one direction, memory in another.<p><p>We are that strange species that constructs artifacts intended to counter
the natural flow of forgetting.<p>[...] We live in, have lived through, a strange time. I know this because
when I was a child, the flow of forgetting was relatively unimpeded. I know
this because the dead were less of a constant presence, then. Because there
was once no Rewind button. Because the soldiers dying in the Somme were
black and white, and did not run as the living run. [...]<p>And as this capacity for recall (and recommodification) grows more
universal, history itself is seen to be even more obviously a construct,
subject to revision.</blockquote><p>Gibson’s non-fiction is not more clearly true than his fiction, but then
his fiction has almost been simple current events reporting. Nevermind that
it comes to us through a veil of sleep — that’s just how Wintermute
interfaces with our minds.<p>Unavoidably, and perhaps for all science fiction, there has always been a
political component to Gibson’s work — not just the excellent <em>Spook
Country</em> — but it is always told with the simple confidence of someone
simply reporting what they’ve seen.<blockquote><p>I hear that things have changed for the better in Singapore, in the years
since my visit, and I am glad. But the Singaporean government responded to
this piece [“Disneyland With the Death Penalty”, for the September 1993
issue of <em>Wired</em>], at the time, by banning the import of
<em>Wired</em> magazine. So I would suppose that this could be said to have
been the most controversial of the pieces collected here.<p>I was subsequently accused, though not by the Singaporean government, of
a sort of perverse neocolonial Ludditism, but my complaint was never that
Singapore was too cutting-edge contemporary, but that it was simply
totalitarian. Though at least it was upfront about it, I would add today,
from the perspective of a harsher era.</blockquote><p>But Gibson has never succumbed to despair or defeatism; indeed,
<em>Neuromancer</em> is in many ways the happy tale of how World War III did
not, as he says in “Dead Man Sings”, replace our TVs with cave paintings. On
H. G. Wells’ techno-cynicism, Gibson says<blockquote><p>I suspect that I began to distrust that particular flavor of italics [in
Wells’ strident denunciation of Edwardian technocrats] when the world didn’t
end in October of 1962. I can’t recall the resolution of the Cuban Missile
Crisis at all. My anxiety, and the world’s, reached some absolute peak. And
then declined, history moving on, so much of it, and sometimes today the
world of my own childhood strikes me as scarcely less remote than the world
of Wells’ childhood, so much has changed in the meantime.</blockquote><p>Perhaps not quite optimistic, but aware of the changeability of things,
and comfortable with that awareness. Gibson’s work turns out to be
surprisingly autobiographical: it’s clear where his characters get their joy
for art, music, The Footage, and blue jeans of inscrutable provenance.
