do something else? How can we improve our overall approach to the “WTF is going
on?” problem?<p>My strong bias is toward the scientific method —  which requires open inquiry
and easy access to knowledge —  and against unreliable or false metrics. I also
strongly resist any make-work or boondoggling that is not directly relevant to
understanding how software works and fails, and making it work more
goodlier.<p>So, I tried to think about vulnerability databases, and what all we might
want from them. First, some definitions.<h2>Definitions</h2><dl><dt>Developer:<dd>An organization which (or lone hacker who) develops
software.<dt>Developer communications:<dd>Communications from developers about
vulnerabilities, including bug trackers, release notes, Knowledge Base articles,
code review and CI/CQ, et c.<dt>Researcher:<dd>An organization which (or lone hacker who) hunts for
vulnerabilities in software.<dt>Researcher communications:<dd>Communications from researchers about
vulnerabilities, including bug trackers, advisories, blog posts, exploits, and
Twitter threads.<dt>Deployer:<dd>An organization or person who is using some software to
achieve a goal.<dt>Vulnerability database program (VDB):<dd>An organization that tracks,
describes, and/or issues alerts for vulnerabilities.</dl><h2>Vulnerability Databases</h2><p>What might we want in a VDB?<ul><li>Information about the nature of the vulnerability, including:<ul><li>specific versions of specific products affected;<li>attack pathways (e.g. unauthenticated internet attacker, authenticated local
user account, et c.);<li>proof of concept (PoC) exploit, unit test, or other test: proof that the bug
is real and that the fix works;<li>availability of the fix;<li>workarounds;<li>mitigating factors;<li>the type of bug (e.g. heap buffer overflow, SQL injection); and<li>the specific locus of the bug (e.g. the login flow, the network-facing
<code>FooHandler</code>, the kernel-mode driver, et c.).</ul><li>Searchability: a unique ID (or a keyword) that search engines can easily
find. The IDs must be unique, and there should not be multiple IDs for the same
bug.<li>Authoritativeness: ideally, most of the community will recognize a given
information source as ✨ The Last Word ✨ in vulnerabilities for the range of
software it covers.<li>Alert quality: timely, relevant, and actionable alerts.<li>Low overhead: for developers to add new entries to the database must be easy
and fast. Researchers should therefore be able to get IDs for their discoveries
quickly.</ul><p>I made a rough comparison of 4 sources of vulnerability information:<table><tr><th class=bottom>Source<th class=bottom>Information<th class=bottom>Searchability<th class=bottom>Authoritativeness<th class=bottom>Alert Quality<th class=bottom>Overhead<tr><th>CVE<td><a href=/2022/04/22/itw-taxonomy/>Poor</a><td>Good<td>Low, due to poor information<td><a id=fn1_back></a>Highly varying<a href=#fn1>①</a><td>High<tr><th><a href=https://www.openwall.com/ove/>OVE</a><td>None; provides only IDs<td>Good<td>None; provides only IDs<td>None; provides only IDs<td><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon>epsilon</a><tr><th>Developer communications<td><a id=fn2_back></a>Highly varying<a href=#fn2>②</a><td>Good<td><a id=fn3_back></a>‘Should be’ ideal but varies with information quality<a href=#fn3>③</a><td>Good<td>None beyond what is inherently necessary<tr><th>Researcher communications<td>Varying; often good<td>Poor<td>Varying; sometimes good<td>Varying; sometimes good<td>None beyond what is inherently necessary</table><p>From this I observe a few things:<p><b>Developer communications have the best ability to meet all our
requirements:</b> developers (should) have the best knowledge about the software
they create, full information about the nature of the bug, full information
about the fix, and full information about remediation. Sometimes developers do
meet our requirements, and that is great. Ideally, they always would. All too
often, they don’t, and keeping communications high quality requires constant
effort and skill from program managers.<p><b>Researcher communications have a great ability to meet our information
requirements in particular.</b> Sometimes they do, and that is great. Sometimes,
they can be more authoritative than reticent developers.<p><b>CVE’s clearest benefit seems to be an authoritative source of unique ID
numbers,</b> plus whatever information the developer might provide (usually very
little). But in my experience the coordination cost is high for developers, and
as a result developers often minimize their use of CVE. Hence OVE: the argument
goes that if all CVE reliably does for us is make numbers, well, we can do that
far more cheaply.<p><b>We might benefit if program managers of VDBs stopped accepting poor, late,
and un-actionable information from developers.</b> The CVE program, as the most
widely recognized VDB, has an opportunity to raise the bar across the industry
by calling out such reticent developers, citing the needs of and benefits to the
public and basic science.<p>For example, imagine if a VDB tagged entries with a message like “Developer
declined to provide meaningful information” when the vendor provided a
meaningless description of the vulnerability. That might exert some salutary
pressure on developers.<p><b>We would benefit if VDBs made it easier for the developer to commit
current information to the database.</b> For example, CVE-2022-2294, which is
currently being exploited in the wild, is documented <a href=https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/07/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html>in
Chrome’s 4 July 2022 release notes</a>, but <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?id=CVE-2022-2294">the CVE
entry</a> as of 8 July contains no information, saying only:<blockquote>** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization
or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the
candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be
provided.</blockquote><p>Perhaps the CVE entry will be eventually consistent with the Chrome release
notes, hopefully including a link to the bug tracker. (<a href=https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/security-labels.md#Drop-Restrict_View_SecurityTeam_SecurityNotify_From-Old-And-Fixed-Bugs>Chrome
policy</a> is to make security bugs public 14 weeks after the fix has shipped,
so a link to the bug tracker will become valuable in time.)<h2>Prioritizing Vulnerability Response</h2><p>What do we want in a vulnerability ‘scoring’ system? (Do we want a
vulnerability scoring system?)<p>As an experiment, I imagined a hypothetical easy to use, network-based,
denial of service (DoS —  not <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_DoS>DDoS</a>)
attack, and tried to score it with CVSS. I assumed there is an existing exploit
that doesn’t completely take down a service, but causes it to consume lots of
time and/or space.<p><a id=fn4_back></a>For example, imagine a database query that, for some
reason, is slow in a given database engine. It is for some reason (less than SQL
injection, more than just using the site normally) remotely-triggerable. Perhaps
an attacker can make some unauthenticated web request that invokes this
expensive query, and it’s expensive only because the query planner has a bug —  normally, the query would be efficient<a href=#fn4>④</a>.<p>The CVSS vector I got is<pre>
AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:F/RL:U/RC:C/CR:X/IR:X/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:N/MS:U/MC:N/MI:N/MA:L
</pre><p>which scores 6.0 in <a href=https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator>NIST’s CVSS 3.1
calculator</a>.<p>Since that string is just noise, let’s look at a graphic:<figure><img src=calculator.png width=1024 height=302 alt="A screenshot of
the NIST CVSS calculator showing the hypothetical bug with a score of 6.0" loading=lazy><figcaption>More readable, though not more
informative.</figcaption></figure><p>What does “6.0” mean? Is it high enough to call <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering>the on-call
SRE</a>? Do we only get out of bed for 7.5 or higher? (Why 7.5?) Is this bug bad
enough to call the vendor to complain —  or sue?<p>Some people might use CVSS to make that kind of decision. It is, after all, a
score telling you how severe a problem is.<p>But there is no single threat model, so there can be no single score that
suits all audiences. Not everyone who uses the DoS-able database engine makes
that kind of inefficient query. Not all deployers of vulnerable platforms need
to worry, even if the bug is present —  maybe their servers are overprovisioned
relative to their load.<p>But what about a shopping site? What about a shopping site during the winter
holiday season? Such a deployer can put a concrete dollar value on the cost of
downtime, and that cost changes from quarter to quarter. In turn, that will
change how the deployer prioritizes different vulnerabilities.<p>Nor do the scores map to real-world costs and risks —  will a vulnerability
with a CVSS score of 10.0 cost you twice as much as (or, say, 5 orders of
magnitude more than) one with a score of 5.0? The question is nonsensical
because nobody has the same cost model, either.<p>The CVSS people are aware of these problems, and have tried to address them.
From <a href=https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide>the CVSS User
Guide</a>:<blockquote><p><b>2.1. CVSS Measures Severity, not Risk</b><p>The CVSS Specification Document has been updated to emphasize and clarify the
fact that CVSS is designed to measure the severity of a vulnerability and should
not be used alone to assess risk.<p>Concerns have been raised that the CVSS Base Score is being used in situations
where a comprehensive assessment of risk is more appropriate. The CVSS v3.1
Specification Document now clearly states that the CVSS Base Score represents
only the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability which are constant over
time and across user environments. The CVSS Base Score should be supplemented
with a contextual analysis of the environment, and with attributes that may
change over time by leveraging CVSS Temporal and Environmental Metrics. More
appropriately, a comprehensive risk assessment system should be employed that
considers more factors than simply the CVSS Base Score. Such systems typically
also consider factors outside the scope of CVSS such as exposure and threat.</blockquote><p>CVSS 3.0 and greater were (presumably) devised to address the problem of
nonsensical scores, such as that <a href=https://heartbleed.com/>Heartbleed</a> —  a bug that lets unauthenticated
internet attackers read secrets out of a server’s memory — <a href=https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2014-0160>scored only 5.0 at the
time</a>. (Click the <b>CVSS Version 2.0</b> button to see it.) At least in the
case of Heartbleed, CVSS 3 results in scores that seem more ‘intuitively
accurate’ —  to those of us assuming a particular class of threat model.<p>However, I find that section quoted above to be a bit of a cop-out, given how
people have reported using CVSS to me. People are using it to make operational
decisions. It also feels insufficient: it’s not just that risk is different for
different people at different times, it’s that severity can vary too!<p>Imagine that a hypothetical shopping app deployer has deployed the DoS-able
database such that each query runs in a sandboxed and resource-limited process.
The deployers have tested their sandbox resource limits such that 99.99% of true
shopping queries succeed, while queries that exceed the memory limit or use more
than some number of milliseconds of compute time are killed. For this deployer,
the severity of the bug goes way down, nearly to zero, even though the cost of
successful attack has stayed the same. This deployer has effectively mitigated
the bug. (This deployment strategy can mitigate many potential bugs, and can
change how the deployer prioritizes a wide variety of vulnerabilities.)<p>Another problem with CVSS is its <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_precision>false precision</a>. If you
look at the calculator, you’ll see that the ‘measurements’ you can make about a
vulnerability are of very coarse ‘precision’, e.g. None –  Low –  High, or (for
Exploit Code Maturity) Not Defined –  Unproven –  PoC – Functional – High. The
measurements are in tertiles, quartiles, and quintiles, yet the calculator
produces results purporting 2 significant figures (e.g. 6.2). This is an
illusion produced by the arithmetic of the CVSS scoring procedure, not actual
measurements of real bug severity.<p>I have my doubts about whether the severity of vulnerabilities can be scored
at all, especially without lots and lots of deployer-specific context. Even with
that context, you still also need a well-grounded cost model —  but it is very
difficult to get one. Not all users that a given deployer is serving will share
a given model, so you may need many cost models. And then you need a way to
balance the concerns of all your constituents —  another complex and
hard-to-ground model. In real life, people make risk decisions much more
qualitatively than we or they would like to believe.<p>That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive for well-grounded quantitative models!
Just that we need to be prepared to act without them, and that CVSS is not
one.<p>If we do away with the spurious numbers and just treat CVSS as purely
qualitative —  which it is, <b>and which is fine!</b> —  we’d have a more honest
and safer-to-use system. (Nobody is really worrying about the difference between
7.6 and 7.4 anyway. At least I hope not.) The basic qualities that CVSS
encompasses are all important and useful, and account for many of the desiderata
at the top of this post.<h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The combination of CVE + CVSS gives us some of what we want, and we could
have more of it at lower cost if any of a few magical things happened:<ul><li>Developers provided meaningful information in their own vulnerability
databases<li>Developers provided meaningful information to VDBs<li>VDBs made it easier for developers to keep entries current and accurate<li>VDBs rejected information-free entries or called them out as such<li>Coordination costs were lowered, such as by removing the ‘global lock’ in
the CVE database (as OVE proposes to do, and which could be done by giving each
<a href=https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/CNAs>CNA</a> its own
‘namespace’ to issue numbers in)<li>The CVSS program embraced its inherent qualitativeness, and shed the
pseudo-quantities.</ul><p>However, it will never be possible to beat the information richness,
searchability, or authoritativeness of a well-run developer communications
program. (This is especially true for projects that are open source as well as
being well-run.) Also great are well-run researcher communications programs —  <a href=/2022/04/22/itw-taxonomy/>Taxonomy Of In-The-Wild Exploitation</a> was
only possible because so many researchers wrote so many great blog posts and
PoCs. (Thank you!)<p>Additionally, there will always be vulnerabilities that are known and fixed
but which don’t get VDB entries. <b>In my experience, the majority of
vulnerabilities go un-numbered</b>, and for those vulnerabilities, this whole
discussion is moot. This is not a fault of any VDB program: although reducing
the friction of working with the program would help, we will always need to
prepare for vulnerabilities that aren’t announced or tracked. You never get
perfect global coordination, no matter how low the friction. And sometimes
developers don’t even realize (or want to admit) that they are fixing a
vulnerability (as opposed to just a regular bug). And sometimes their own bug
trackers are already easier to use and more useful than a global database.<p>Therefore no VDB can ever be the sole trigger for action on the part of
deployers. The only reliable way to get all the available fixes is to track the
latest stable version. No matter how good any VDB gets, that will always be true —  and deployers who do so will be insulated from gaps and mistakes on the part
of developers and of VDB programs.<p>For the sake of public safety —  and, honestly, just for the pride of
engineering excellence —  we must improve the quality and discoverability of
vulnerability information, and reduce the cost of providing and getting it.
There’s a lot of room for us to do a lot better as a community. The status quo
is not working.<hr><p><a id=fn1></a><a href=#fn1_back><b>1.</b></a> When CVE alerts are of
low quality, it is not typically the ‘fault’ of the CVE program itself. Software
development organizations must provide timely, relevant, and actionable
information; if they don’t, there’s not much the CVE program can do.<p><a id=fn2></a><a href=#fn2_back><b>2.</b></a> Some developer bug
trackers are great and have most or all of the properties we want. This is
typically, but neither inherently nor historically only, seen in the trackers
for open source projects. But other developers provide very little information,
intentionally hide information, or don’t even have bug trackers at all.<p><a id=fn3></a><a href=#fn3_back><b>3.</b></a> When the developer’s bug
tracker is information-poor, then researchers’ bug trackers, advisories, and
blogs become more authoritative.<p><a id=fn4></a><a href=#fn4_back><b>4.</b></a> I once really had a bug
like this, on a security review engagement years ago. The client told me that
their biggest fear was that 1 tenant in their multi-tenant platform would starve
other tenants of resources, so they had strict quotas around CPU time and memory
allocation. I was able to make <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44487537/why-does-naive-string-concatenation-become-quadratic-above-a-certain-length>the
string allocation routine in their language runtime go quadratic</a> in a way
that their quota system couldn’t see, but which I could and did time remotely. I
fired off a few pathological requests, and the development server became
unresponsive. So I wrote it up and went to lunch, since I couldn’t test any
more. For this client, it was the most high-priority bug to fix; but for others,
it might not matter as much or at all.</article></main><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the
