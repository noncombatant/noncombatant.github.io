Responsible Fintech Policy</a>, a factual and reasonable call for Congress to
resist intense lobbying from crypto-speculators and venture capitalists<a href=#fn1 id=fn1_back>①</a>,
cryptographer Matthew Green has responded
with a blog post <a href=https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2022/06/09/in-defense-of-cryptocurrency/>In
defense of crypto(currency)</a> that doesn’t effectively rebut the letter to
Congress. Instead, he confirms most of their points.<p>(I say <i>cryptoassets</i>, not <i>cryptocurrencies</i>, because they’re not
viable as currencies: they’re designed to be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation>deflationary</a> and
have proven
<a href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/>absurdly volatile</a>. Of
course, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory>the greater
fool</a> left holding the bag will find they’re not assets in the colloquial
sense, either.)<p>I wouldn’t normally bother writing about cryptoassets, because they’re absurd
and <a href=https://web3isgoinggreat.com/>immediately discredit themselves</a>
better than I could. However, Green’s defense is interesting because he has
significant credentials and experience in cryptography. He is also a
co-developer of a leading privacy-protective (<a href=https://www.coindesk.com/price/zcash/>and deflationary</a>)
cryptoasset,
<a href=https://z.cash/>Zcash</a>. So we can reasonably hope for
better-informed and coherent arguments than we normally see from
crypto-boosters.<p>But the fact that a uniquely-qualified expert in the field is not able to
rebut legitimate concerns, including the ones he raises, is interesting enough
to comment on. Like Green, I’m sure I’ll regret this.<blockquote><h2>Objection: “Cryptocurrency is terrible for the
environment”</h2></blockquote><p>Green cedes this point. His rebuttal is that we can fix that with
what he agrees is oligarchy:<blockquote>Proof-of-stake systems are not perfect: they still lead to some
centralization of power, since in this paradigm the rich tend to get richer.
However it’s hard to claim that the result will be worse than the
semi-centralized mess that proof-of-work mining has turned into.</blockquote><p>While <a href=https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/>boosters estimate
that proof-of-stake will reduce energy consumption by 3 orders of magnitude</a>,
it’s worth noting that oligarchy is very bad, actually<a href=#fn2 id=fn2_back>②</a>. It’s something we should
be looking to solve, not
exacerbate. People who don’t like centralization should, in theory, agree; but,
of course, most anarcho-capitalists believe that <b>they</b> will get to be <a href=https://madmax.fandom.com/wiki/Immortan_Joe>Immortan Joe</a>. When you
scratch the surface of anarcho-capitalism you typically find feudalism, as we do
here.<p>So we don’t seem to have any solution to the theoretical<a href=#fn3 id=fn3_back>③</a> computing science
problem of distributed consensus that
isn’t also hugely destructive to the world in some way. Green presents no
argument that the best way to solve “the semi-centralized mess that
proof-of-work mining has turned into” is anything other than simply not doing
PoW or PoS.<p>To round this section out, Green repeats the punchline that Ethereum 2 is
coming <a href=https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/13/ethereum-merge-no-longer-expected-in-june/>Real
Soon Now</a>, and mentions in passing that <a href=https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/05/23/cryptocurrency-chia-waste-resources-bitcoin/>wasting
hard drives</a> is also an option.<blockquote><h2>Objection: “Public blockchains can never support banking
features like transaction reversal.”</h2></blockquote><p>Green’s rebuttal seems to be twofold: (1) stablecoins are centralized and
hence can freeze or burn money; and (2) smart contracts could say anything,
including provisions for reversal.<p>In the cryptoasset ideology, centralization is The Big Problem That Must Be
Solved (Unless We Get To Be The Feudal Lords, In Which Case Centralization Is
Awesome). So presenting centralization as a solution is not functional as a
rebuttal.<p>There’s also the small matter that <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3888752">stablecoins
are basically a rebirth of the ‘wildcat’ banks of the 19th century</a> —  hardly
a compelling vision for the future.<p>It might be true that smart contracts could have provisions for reversal, but
the reality on the ground today is that ‘code is law’, those ‘laws’ don’t
typically have reversal provisions, and they end up being <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27665297">“self-funding bug
bounties”</a> that just destroy people’s ‘assets’ in an automated way.<p>Green does not mention that stablecoins have a history of being <a href=https://crypto-anonymous-2021.medium.com/the-bit-short-inside-cryptos-doomsday-machine-f8dcf78a64d3>fantastically
crimey</a> and/or <a href=https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/luna-crypto-crash-how-ust-broke-and-whats-next-for-terra/>not
even a little bit stable</a>.<p>So perhaps the letter authors are wrong that public blockchains can “never”
support transaction reversal. Anyway, the combination of reversible +
decentralized doesn’t exist now. Perhaps there will be a flurry of innovation in
the area of smart contracts that enable refunds, but we’d still face the
question of why that’s better than regular bank databases.<blockquote><h2>Objection: “Cryptocurrency doesn’t scale [or the fees are too
damned high]”</h2></blockquote><p>Again, Green starts out by confirming the critics’ point. He reassures us
that the problem is <a href=https://wiki.c2.com/?SimpleMatterOfProgramming>A
Simple Matter Of Programming</a>, but cautions us that while the ideal speed-up
would be 100x —  within an order of magnitude of what Visa can handle on a
non-holiday now with 1970s technology, so maybe borderline feasible —  the
reality won’t be that big.<p>Nicholas Weaver, one of the lead signers of the letter, has <a href=https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/web3-fraud>a different
back-of-the-envelope calculation</a>:<blockquote><p>Estimating the cost (measured in ‘gas’) of an arbitrary computation is
complex but let’s assume that we are only interested in the most simple
operation: 256 bit integer addition. Each addition costs 3 gas each. So on a
worldwide basis this system rates at 600,000 adds per second.<p>Compare this amount of compute to a Raspberry Pi 4, a $45 single-board
computer which has four processors running at 1.5 GHz. Each core has 2 ALUs and
it will take 4 instructions to perform a 256 bit addition, as the basic unit for
the Raspberry Pi (and most other modern computers) is 64 bits. So each core has
a peak performance of 750,000,000 adds per second for a total peak of
3,000,000,000 adds per second. Put bluntly, the Ethereum “world computer” has
roughly 1/5,000 of the compute power of a Raspberry Pi 4!</blockquote><p>By Weaver’s critical estimate, even the big dream of a 100x speed-up is not
enough to make the Ethereum network a good use of the planet’s computational
resources. Nor would the Ethereum Foundation’s claim of a 2000x speed-up enable
the Ethereum network to outpace a Raspberry Pi.<p>Green also confirms that<blockquote>Many defenders have tried to paint the electricity consumption of
Bitcoin and other PoW currencies as “green” or define it as a form of energy
storage. This is dishonest nonsense: estimates hold that at east 60% of mining
energy consumption still comes from fossil sources.</blockquote><p>Perhaps some other defense of cryptocurrencies will hold. Let’s see:<blockquote><h2>Objection: “There is no privacy on blockchains (or there is too
much privacy)”</h2></blockquote><p>There has, in fact, been innovation in cryptoasset privacy, and Green’s own
work demonstrates that.<p>Unfortunately, that’s very bad, even if also potentially good in some way. <a href=https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/blockchain-and-the-utopia-of-a-anarcho-capitalist-society-2763.htm>The
anarcho-capitalist dream of cryptoassets</a> —  i.e. <a href=https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html>tax
evasion and money-laundering</a> — is one of the only parts of the cryptoasset
dream that reliably comes true in practice. The cryptoasset economy has been a
huge ‘success’ in enabling <a href=https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-ransomware/>ransomware</a>,
<a href=https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/law-enforcement-agencies-cryptocurrency/>CSAM</a>,
and <a href=https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ties-north-korean-hacker-group-lazarus-huge-cryptocurrency-theft-2022-04-14/>Kim
Jong Un’s nuclear program</a> (on top of the more mundane phenomenon of regular
people losing their money).<p>It’s not clear why people who want functioning government, un-abused
children, and fewer nuclear weapons would welcome a more-private cryptoasset.
Perhaps there is an argument that the potential benefits would outweigh the
actual harms we endure right now, but Green doesn’t make it in this article, and
doesn’t contend with the harms.<p>Green attempts to paint the status quo as equivalently risky as the current
systems of exchange:<blockquote>But at very least they’ll be better than our current
collect-it-all-and-then-hand-it-to-hackers approach, which certainly has not
done us very many favors.</blockquote><p>but it’s hard not to see cryptoassets as even more accurately described as
“handing it to hackers”.<blockquote><h2>So why do I care about any of this?</h2></blockquote><p>In this section, Green presents the problems that cryptoassets should
supposedly solve, and which should motivate a long blog post to defend
cryptoassets. Buried the lede, tbh, but:<ul><li>Credit card fees are too high<li>Credit cards are still prone to the same kinds of fraud as in 1995<li>We don’t have privacy in our payments<li>You can’t pay with your phone unless you want to give control to
corporations<li>Regulatory capture</ul><p>After 4,000 words in defense of cryptoassets, this is the
<s>lede</s>conclusion:<blockquote><p>I don’t know if blockchains are the solution to this problem. [...]<p>So while I don’t know if cryptocurrency will be the answer, I’m just hopeful
that something will be.</blockquote><p>So at the end of what could be a strong defense of cryptoassets, we find that
they are not in fact defensible, and that the letter to Congress is basically
right on every point.<p>But, the problems Green identifies are real, and it would be good to solve
them. So let’s consider how cryptoassets deal with these problems.<p>Credit card fees are too high: As Green notes, cryptoasset fees are not
exactly low. <a href=https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800995/constitutiondao-refund-progress-steep-gas-fees-cryptocurrency>In
some cases, they’re a deal-breaker</a>. They are also far more volatile. And
there is no viable solution at hand, in Green’s post or elsewhere.<p>Credit cards are still prone to fraud: Clearly, this is as true today as it
was in 1995. Unfortunately, cryptoassets have not only not reduced fraud but
have brought us new and exciting additional forms of fraud. “Back in my day,”
I’ll say, “we had fewer forms of financial fraud!” The grandkids roll their eyes
in disbelief.<p>We don’t have privacy in our payments: As above, this is a policy debate that
we can and should have. Whatever approach to payment privacy we take, it will
have to do something to mitigate the severe harms that sort-of-private and
pseudonymous cryptocurrencies have enabled and exacerbated.<p>And it will require a nuanced construction of privacy, which is often
presented as —  but which is not — a simple binary condition. (It’s not even as
simple as a spectrum along a single axis.) There does not yet appear to be a
plausible approach on the table that provides people privacy (however defined)
and yet stops at least some large-scale, society-damaging crime. Maybe
someday.<p>You can’t pay with your phone without giving control to corporations: That
does seem to be true, whether it’s to Apple, Google, Safaricom (which operates
M-Pesa in Kenya), PayPal, Zelle, or various state-capital corporations in China.
Since Green dismisses existing state and government solutions, I take it he
would only be satisfied by currency purely run on distributed consensus. Thus he
appears to embrace the anarcho-capitalist dream, but doesn’t have anything to
say (in this article) about what would check and balance capital power <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/10/when-you-drown-government-bathtub-people-die/>once
government is “drowned in the bathtub”</a>.<p>Regulatory capture: Recall that the letter to Congress was from concerned
experts <b>warning legislators to be wary of regulatory capture by speculators
and VCs</b> — and, again, Green says he broadly agrees with the lead signers’
spirit —  so it’s hard to see how cryptoassets are a solution to regulatory
capture. In fact that’s the problem at hand!<h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Green’s defense of cryptoassets is no more coherent than what we’ve seen
before. But it does have the virtue of honesty, which inevitably makes it a very
weak defense of cryptoassets.<p>The Letter in Support of Responsible Fintech Policy stands as reasonable
advice to legislators, and cryptoassets still look like <a href=https://webcomicname.com/post/152958755984>a
change for the
worse</a>.<hr><p><a id=fn1></a><a href=#fn1_back><b>1.</b></a> I also signed it, but

<i>theoretical</i> in the technical sense, not in a colloquial sense of
“unimportant”. It would be useful to have a solution to the distributed
consensus problem. But we don’t need a solution so badly that burning the Earth
is a good idea, and we don’t need one that furthers anarcho-capitalism.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
