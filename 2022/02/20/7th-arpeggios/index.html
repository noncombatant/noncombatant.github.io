🦋&nbsp;<a href=https://bsky.app/profile/fugueish.bsky.social>Bluesky</a></nav><h1>Arpeggios Of 7th Chords</h1><p><time>20 February 2022</time><p>I took some guitar lessons from <a href=https://twitter.com/AndeeBlackSugar>Andee Blacksugar</a> for a good long
while, and had some fun. One thing he taught me was this 2ax yb—cx yd1ax yb—cx yd2ax yb—cx yd1ax yb—cx yd2 pattern for
7th-chord arpeggios: root and 3rd on ⑤, 5th on ④, 7th and octave on ③, 3rd on ②,
and 5th and 7th on ①. I find it easier to play than other arpeggio patterns I’ve
learned.<p>For fun, I decided to write out one of the warm-up exercises I wrote that
uses this pattern. It just goes up the scale and back down again in scale
degrees, but there are some amusing twists: the metric phasing, and the legato
makes the picking seem weird (but it strictly follows the “down on the beat, up
on the up-beat” patternax yb—cx yd it only <i>seems</i> weird).<p>I notated the fretting-hand fingerings I use; your mileage my vary. On the
major 7th shape, for example, you can barre or roll your 2nd finger on ③ and ②
instead of my perhaps-idiosyncratic fingering.</p><iframe src=7th-arpeggios-exercise.pdf width=100% height=500 loading=lazy></iframe><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
