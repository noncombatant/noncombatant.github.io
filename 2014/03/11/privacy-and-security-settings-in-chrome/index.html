a <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/palmerized-chrome/ecmhflkoahhjjpddfopclbhiogelneoc>Chrome
extension</a>. So, now you can just install that rather than noodling through
all these settings.<p>Also, be aware that Chrome’s Settings UX has changed a bit since I wrote
this.</aside><p><a href=https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/>Chrome</a> has a lot
of handy privacy and security options, but it isn’t always obvious how to use
them. In this post I’ll demonstrate my favorites, and try to explain a bit about
what they do.<p>My goal with these configuration changes is to get Chrome to expose less
attack surface to potentially malicious web pages, and to be less chatty on the
network. I definitely can’t and don’t guarantee that they will work for you or
solve any particular problem you have. But maybe you’ll find this to be a fun
learning experience. (Also, although I work for Google on the Chrome Security
team, I am not blogging in any official capacity, and I don’t have an omniscient
view of Chrome security.)<p>Chrome has a feature that allows you to create multiple “profiles”, each with
their own distinct settings. Because we want to change the settings in a way
that will make some web sites work less well (or even not at all), we won’t want
to be locked in that mode. Therefore, we need to create a new, distinct profile
to use as the private/secure mode. That way, you can always go back to a regular
profile easily, to get normal web functionality.<p>First, create a new profile:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Create a new profile." src=01-create-new-profile.png width=746 height=610><figcaption>Create a
new profile.</figcaption></figure><p>After creating the new profile, you get a new window running that profile
(note the cat icon in the upper right corner):<figure><img loading=lazy alt="After creating a new profile." width=747 height=612 src=02-after-profile-creation.png><figcaption>After creating a
new profile.</figcaption></figure><p>In this privacy- and security-sensitive special profile, do not sign in to
Chrome. Signing in to Chrome, also known as Chrome Sync, is a convenient feature
that syncs all your settings across all your signed-in Chrome profiles on all
your devices, and makes it easier to log in to Google services. You might like
it in your regular mode profile, but we want this profile be more loosely
coupled to the cloud.<p>Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> page <em>in the new profile’s
window</em>, and click on “Show advanced settings...” (shown here at the
bottom):<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Show Advanced Settings." src=03-advanced-settings.png width=786 height=612><figcaption>Show
Advanced Settings.</figcaption></figure><p>Scroll down to the <strong>Privacy</strong> section of the
<strong>Settings</strong> page, and check or un-check the various options as you
see fit. Here’s how I set them for this profile:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="My preferred Privacy settings." src=04-privacy-settings.png width=786 height=611><figcaption>My preferred
Privacy settings.</figcaption></figure><p>These options (except for Do Not Track) cause Chrome to send extra traffic on
the network (some of that traffic is encrypted), and is a prime candidate for
un-checking — especially if you intend to use Chrome with <a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Tor</a>. For more information, see the <a href=https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/privacy/whitepaper.html>Chrome
Privacy Whitepaper</a>. (In particular, think carefully about disabling phishing
and malware protection; see <a href=//www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/privacy/whitepaper.html#malware>its
section in the privacy whitepaper</a>.)<p>Click on that <strong>Content settings...</strong> button here in
the <strong>Privacy</strong> section, as well:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Block 3rd party data and clear all upon exit." src=04a-cookies-local-data.png width=721 height=366><figcaption>Block 3rd
party data and clear all upon exit.</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve changed the <strong>Cookies</strong> and site data settings, as you can
see: “Block third-party cookies and site data” means that when you are reading
e.g. http://blog.example.com, an ad included  in the page from
http://ad-company.com cannot set new cookies or site data. “Keep local data only
until I quit my browser” means that Chrome will clear the locally-stored data
(like cookies and <a href=http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html>HTML5
LocalStorage</a>) when you quit. (This is similar to, but not exactly the same
as, <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en">what Chrome’s
Incognito mode provides</a>.)<p>Scroll down and you will see many more options for <strong>Content
settings</strong>. I’ll highlight some that are particularly important. First,
block JavaScript by default:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Block JavaScript by default." src=05-no-javascript.png width=343 height=132><figcaption>Block
JavaScript by default.</figcaption></figure><p>However, you can optionally re-enable JavaScript in HTTPS pages:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Enable JavaScript on HTTPS page loads." src=06-javascript-exceptions.png width=549 height=409><figcaption>Enable
JavaScript on HTTPS page loads.</figcaption></figure><p>I like to do this so that I can get rich JavaScript functionality in web
sites like Twitter and Gmail that go to the trouble of authenticating themselves
(and their code) using HTTPS — but sites serving unauthenticated junk cannot run
JavaScript. It’s interesting how many sites still work without JavaScript.
(Sometimes they even work slightly better.)<p>Next, we disallow external protocol handlers, and we block all plug-ins:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Disallow external protocol handlers and block
all plugins." src=07-no-handlers-block-plugins.png width=549 height=340><figcaption>Disallow external protocol handlers and block all
plugins.</figcaption></figure><p>Important note about blocking plug-ins: The “Click to play” option means that
plug-ins are disabled by default, but that you can (left-)click on their area on
the screen to run them. However, that left-click is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking>clickjackable</a>. It’s better
to select “Block all”, which is really “right-click to play” — yes, you can
still run plug-ins when you want to. To run plug-ins, right-click on their
screen area, which brings up a native-type (operating system) context menu, and
select <strong>Run This Plug-in</strong>:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Run This Plug-in" src=screen-shot-2014-01-19-at-9-52-26-pm.png width=644 height=571><figcaption>You can run or not run plug-ins at
run-time.</figcaption></figure><p>Thus, you can be ensured that plug-ins run only when you want them to.<p>Next, we disable location services and notifications:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Disable location services and notifications." src=08-no-location-no-notifications.png width=517 height=341><figcaption>Disable location services and
notifications.</figcaption></figure><p>Disallow sites from taking over the mouse or capturing data from media
sensors:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Disallow sites from taking over the mouse or
capturing data from media sensors." src=09-no-mouse-control-no-media.png width=587 height=405><figcaption>Disallow sites from taking over the mouse
or capturing data from media sensors.</figcaption></figure><p>Turn off un-sandboxed plugins and don’t allow automatic downloads:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="No un-sandboxed (NPAPI) plugins and no
automatic downloads." src=10-no-unsandboxed-no-auto-download.png width=591 height=347><figcaption>No un-sandboxed (NPAPI) plugins and no automatic
downloads.</figcaption></figure><p>Do not remember passwords or form field entries:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Do not remember passwords or form field
entries." src=11-no-passwords-no-forms.png width=600 height=139><figcaption>Do not remember passwords or form field
entries.</figcaption></figure><p>Tell Chrome not to auto-detect what language the page is in, to ask where to
place each download, and not to fetch certificate revocation data:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Don’t auto-translate, ask where to place each
download, and don’t fetch certificate revocation data." src=12-languages-downloads-revocation.png width=536 height=347><figcaption>Don’t auto-translate, ask where to place each
download, and don’t fetch certificate revocation data.</figcaption></figure><p>Note that you can still use Google Translate by right-clicking on a page and
selecting <strong>Translate to English</strong> (or whatever your native
language is). Un-checking “Offer to translate...” disables the automatic
language detection functionality.<p>We leave certificate revocation disabled by default because <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol>the
protocol that does it</a> can leak information about your browsing to a
server.<p>Finally, visit chrome://plugins and affirmatively disable the ones you don’t
need, for good measure:<figure><img loading=lazy alt="Disable plug-ins." src=screen-shot-2014-01-19-at-10-09-03-pm.png width=774 height=678><figcaption>Disable plug-ins.</figcaption></figure><p>Have fun!<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is
