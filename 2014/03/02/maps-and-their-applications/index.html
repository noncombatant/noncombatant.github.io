how one of her programming problems could be solved using a Python
dictionary or JavaScript object. In fact, you can use a dictionary in lots
of ways. Here are some:<ul><li>As a set (an unordered group of elements, each element appearing only
once). For example, you can get the unique elements of a list or array by
collapsing them into the keys of a dictionary.<li>As the underlying storage for the fields of a dynamic object. “Dynamic
object” here means “an object that gets fields added or removed”. E.g. in
JavaScript, you can add new fields and values at any time to an object,
while in Java or C the fields of an object are static and unchanging once
defined. (And, for that reason, accessing the fields of a Java or C object
can be done in a much faster way.)<li>As a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_array>sparse
array</a>.<li>As the storage for a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization>memoized function</a> (which
can, in turn, be a way to optimize expensive functions, including expensive
recursive functions). <a href=https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecoratorLibrary#Memoize>With
Python decorators, you can easily memoize any function</a>, and the
canonical way to do that is with a dictionary.<li>Many other cache applications.<li><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_coder>Data compression</a>.</ul><p>For the rest of this post I’ll use the term <em>map</em> to refer to what
various languages/APIs/sources in the literature call <em>dictionaries</em>,
<em>hashes</em>, “objects” (only? in a JavaScript context), <em>associative
arrays</em>, <em>symbol tables</em>, or <em>tables</em>. A map is any data
structure that groups a dynamic number of <em>key-value pairs</em> together,
and allows us to retrieve values by key, to insert new key-value pairs, and
to update the values associated with keys. We almost always require that the
data structure allow us to do these operations very quickly. (After all,
we’re going to be using them all the time to solve lots of problems!)<p>Most, but not all, languages come with some kind of map interface built-in. Notably, the C language does not (but C++ does).<p>You can implement a map in many ways. Here are some examples:<ul><li>A simple <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list>linked
list</a> of pairs. This will be slow (O(n)), and insufficient for general
use.<li>A <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table>hash table</a>. This
is generally very fast (roughly O(1)), although it requires you to have a
good hash function for your key type. Most languages allow you to provide a
custom hash function for your object types (e.g. the <code>__hash__</code>
method in Python, or the <code>hashCode</code> method in Java).<li>A <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree>binary
search tree</a>. Fast (O(lg n)). Unlike in a hash table, the keys will be
ordered.  This could be a useful property.<li>A <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list>skip list</a>.</ul><p>Note that although a general-purpose map is useful for many problems, it is
not always ideal for a particular problem. For example, although you can use a
map as a set, it’s a bit of a waste of space — it’s a set of key-value pairs,
but you only need the key. Similarly, maybe you need not only to take the unique
elements from a group of elements, but also to print them out in sorted order.
If your dictionary type is implemented as a hash table, you’ll have to sort the
keys (at an additional cost of O(n lg n) plus the memory allocation to store the
keys in an array). By contrast, if your dictionary is implemented as a binary
search tree, after you are done inserting all the elements, they’ll already be
sorted. (The trade-off is that it might have cost more to insert the elements.
When in doubt, test!)<p>Because one size does not fit all, many languages provide a variety of
map and set implementations. For example, C++ has <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/>map</a>, <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/>set</a>, <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_map/>unordered_map</a>,
and <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/>unordered_set</a>.
The <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html>Java Map
interface</a> has many implementations. Other languages, like Python, Perl,
Ruby, and JavaScript, provide just one map implementation — usually a hash
table of some kind. Some, like Python, also provide a distinct <a href=http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set>set</a> type or
API, and you should use it when it fits your needs.<p>It’s a good exercise to implement a map yourself, in at least one way, in
at least one language. I recommend starting with a simple hash table, and
then working up to a good binary search tree like a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree>red-black
tree</a>.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
