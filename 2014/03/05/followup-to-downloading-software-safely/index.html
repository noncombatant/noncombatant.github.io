ü¶ã&nbsp;<a href=https://bsky.app/profile/fugueish.bsky.social>Bluesky</a></nav><h1>Followup To Downloading Software Safely</h1><p><time>5 March 2014</time><p>I‚Äôve received some emails, tweets, and Hacker News comments about my post <a href=http://noncombatant.org/2014/03/03/downloading-software-safely-is-nearly-impossible/>Downloading
Software Safely Is Nearly Impossible</a>. Thanks for reading and I hope you got
a kick out of my mumblings.<p>I‚Äôd like to address some of the comments and questions people had, as briefly
as possible.<ul><li><p>Yes, you need a trusted computing base (TCB). I alluded to this when I
said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty sure the NSA did not¬†<a href=http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/12/29/report-nsa-intercepting-laptops-ordered-online-installing-spyware/>interdict
it during shipment</a>, and thus that it comes only with the flaky goatware
Microsoft, Lenovo, and any number of Lenovo‚Äôs business partners intended for it
to have.‚Äù Our goal as security engineers is to limit the size of the TCB. It is,
after all, quite goaty already...<li><p>The TCB includes the set of X.509 trust anchors for our TLS
library.<li><p>Yes, I harp on and on about HTTPS. That is because authenticating the
delivery channela‚Ääb‚Äîc‚Äädwhile not necessarily sufficient to indicate code integritya‚Ääb‚Äîc‚Äädis the bare minimum effort we should require from our software sources.
Especially for software that is related to cryptography and security. Here is
GnuPG‚Äôs bug tracker; would you want to log into it or report security-sensitive
bugs using it? :</ul><figure><img alt="GnuPG‚Äôs bug tracker: Not inspiring confidence." src=gnupg-bug-tracker.png width=787 height=518 loading=lazy><figcaption>Not inspiring confidence.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><p>Also note that there are at least 2 different problems with HTTPS in that
post: HTTPS not being available, and the HTTPS site differing in contents from
the HTTP site. Again, for a software distribution site, we‚Äôd like <a href=http://noncombatant.org/2014/01/16/security-smells-for-modern-software/>something
that smells a bit better</a>.<li><p>Some people claim that PGP keyservers don‚Äôt need to use HTTPS, because
the keys authenticate themselves with the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust>web of trust</a>. And it‚Äôs
true, the WoT does allow us to fairly easily distinguish <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;search=0x47518EC82F1123AD">this
fake key</a> from <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;search=0xC11B36DC9C7DD150">this
real key</a> for EFF‚Äôs Seth Schoen. But,<ul><li><p>Seth is one of the most well-connected people in the WoT, so a key with
only 1 signature stands out as odd. Would a fake key for a normal person stand
out so well? The WoT is not as good an authentication mechanism as we might hope
it to be. As nice as it is, verifying software packages based on PGP keys we
grab from key servers is thus not a slam-dunk alternative to or replacement for
HTTPSa‚Ääb‚Äîc‚Äädand nevermind the usability delta between HTTPS and PGP.<li><p>By now, we understand that metadata for communications is at least as
valuable as the contents, in many cases. Shouldn‚Äôt PGP users have
confidentiality in their directory lookups? Yes.</ul><li><p>Yes, as many commentators noted, we should use something like <a href=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc750035.aspx>Authenticode</a>:
binaries should be signed, and their signatures checked at run- or install-time.
However, that still requires a TCB of code-signing trust anchors (the same
companies that are your TLS trust anchors), and the difficulty for users of
verifying the code authors is at least as difficult as verifying the
authenticity of an HTTPS web origin. I.e., not super easy. Definitely better
than nothing.<li><p>This is an extremely hard problem, no doubt about it. Although my post
is very snarky and sarcastic, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an easy problem. I also fight
the problem uphill.<li><p>A big part of the solution is to isolate sources of code based on their
cryptographic identity. This is how Android works, and it is how the open web
works (when you use HTTPS or other authenticated origins). I‚Äôm not very
knowledgeable about iOS, but I understand they also rely on code-signing and on
sandboxing. If the isolation is strong, much of the risk is reduceda‚Ääb‚Äîc‚Äädremember,
a big part of my problem was that PuTTY (or any program) runs with the full
privilege of my user account on the platform. Reduce the privilege, reduce the
problem.<ul><li>If course, now the problem is exposing a privilege-granting UI to users so
that applications can share with explicit approval. One size does not fit all,
and that continues to be a hard secure UX problem.</ul><li><p>Finally, I‚Äôm not really a fan of Web Crypto. I think more mistakes will
be made with it than successes; it‚Äôs just that I also think that of native-code
crypto. The problem does not lie with the implementation environment, but with
the (often perverse) incentives developers have combined with the high level of
expertise needed to use cryptography appropriately and well. Clearly, all the
people who hope to use web crypto to replace TLS, implement DRM, achieve
security against the server that sent the JS, implement homebrew
challenge-response protocols, and so on are in for a heartbreak. But still,
there are potentially good applications for cryptographic algorithms exposed to
JavaScript, and native code does not have a privileged place in crypto. If
anything, due to the lack of privilege separation in legacy platforms, native
code is a worse place to put powerful code.</ul><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
