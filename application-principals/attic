<h3>Academia Can Lead</h3>

<p>TODO: CHERI, RISC-V are good experiments that may lead to better deployed
solutions for (a) defending against architectural and micro-architectural bugs
that existing hardware can’t break compatibility with; and (b) providing better
support for more and finer-grained principals.</p>

under brittleness, Windows:

<p>Historically, Microsoft has prioritized backwards compatibility, especially
for popular applications (<a

story</a>). Microsoft typically extensively tests existing applications before
releasing new versions of Windows. Thus this off-label usage of
<code>RevertToSelf</code> ‘should’ be safe — but there’s no particular
guarantee. And Microsoft has moved to a new model of releasing OS updates more
frequently, including Developer and Beta releases (which presumably receive less
thorough testing). Although that is generally a good move, it increases the risk
that the semantics of Chromium’s usage could change, at least temporarily.</p>

brittleness, macOS:

Chromium engineers have resorted to reverse engineering to learn the policy
language, and invoke explicitly non-public funtions to enable custom policies.
