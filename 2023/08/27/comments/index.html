but necessary, or better than no comments, and so on. It‚Äôs one of those debates
where everyone is right part of the time, and nobody really convinces anybody,
and then we do it again next month.<p>Maybe a year or so ago, some colleagues and I were going around this
merry-go-round again, and Drew Fisher actually shed some light on the discussion
that I hadn‚Äôt seen before. He said, ‚ÄúComments should explain why, not what.‚Äù I
realized it‚Äôs the <i>what</i> comments that I dislike ‚Äî¬†they are redundant at
best, and contradict the actual code at worst (which happens frequently, in my
experience). It‚Äôs the <i>why</i> comments that I like, and I bet most of us
do.<p>There seem to be at least 3 kinds of comments in software code:<dl><dt><i>should</i> comments<dd>that talk about what the code should do, or
what callers should do;<dt><i>what</i> comments<dd>that talk about what code does; and<dt><i>why</i> comments<dd>that explain why the code does what it does, or
why or when callers should call it.</dl><p>The state of comments in many codebases is not ideal. Often, we can and
should<ul><li>replace <i>should</i> comments with code that checks;<li>replace <i>what</i> comments with meaningful identifiers; and<li>explain <i>why</i> more often and more thoroughly.</ul><p>Code examples in this post are in Go, since I work in a Go shop these
days.<h2>Replace Should Comments With Code</h2><p>Here‚Äôs an example of a <i>should</i> comment (that also does not explain
why):<pre>
// RunCommand runs command with the correct arguments for our application.
//
// The command should be one of "pumpkin", "noodle", or "tootle".
func RunCommand(command string) error {
	cmd := exec.Command(command, "woop", "boing")
	cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
	cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
	return cmd.Run()
}
</pre><p>The <code>command</code> argument is a shell command, so we can imagine that
the <i>why</i> is that we need to restrict the commands to 1 of a few known-safe
commands ‚Äî¬†we don‚Äôt want to create a shell injection vulnerability! But it‚Äôs not
great to make the reader imagine or guess. We should tell them.<p>This code enforces the should and avoids the vulnerability ‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs safe even
if the authors of callers didn‚Äôt read the comment:<pre>
var SafeCommands = []string{
	"pumpkin",
	"noodle",
	"tootle",
}

// RunCommand runs command (which must be one of the SafeCommands) with the
// correct arguments for our application.
func RunCommand(command string) error {
	if !slices.Contains(SafeCommands, command) {
		return fmt.Errorf("%q is not in SafeCommands", command)
	}
	cmd := exec.Command(command, "woop", "boing")
	cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
	cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
	return cmd.Run()
}
</pre><p>Explaining why commands must be safe is a good idea, too:<pre>
// SafeCommands limits the commands that RunCommand will run. This limit is
// necessary because we must prevent shell injection vulnerabilities and
// because even without injection, some commands are dangerous to run. Before
// you change this list, get approval from the SREs.
var SafeCommands = []string{
	"pumpkin",
	"noodle",
	"tootle",
}
</pre><p>This is now pretty good: we‚Äôve replaced a should comment with an assertion
that stops bad things from happening, and we explain why it‚Äôs necessary to stop
bad things and why commands can be bad.<p>Personally, I‚Äôm still not entirely satisfied with this for 2 reasons:<ol><li>I‚Äôd like for attempted invocations of unsafe commands to fail early, at
compile time rather than at run time.<li>The comments are duplicative, and will need to be updated if the names
<code>RunCommand</code> or <code>SafeCommands</code> change. People don‚Äôt always
remember to do this when making changes, and then the comments refer to things
that no longer exist.</ol><p>This code, which creates a type that callers outside the current package
can‚Äôt construct a meaningful instance of, gets closer to that ideal:<pre>
// SafeCommands limits the commands that RunCommand will run. This limit is
// necessary because we must prevent shell injection vulnerabilities and
// because even without injection, some commands are dangerous to run.
type SafeCommand struct {
	command string
}

// Before you change or add to these SafeCommands, get approval from the SREs.
var Pumpkin SafeCommand = SafeCommand{command: "pumpkin"}
var Noodle SafeCommand = SafeCommand{command: "noodle"}
var Tootle SafeCommand = SafeCommand{command: "tootle"}

// RunCommand runs command with the correct arguments for our application.
func RunCommand(command SafeCommand) error {
	cmd := exec.Command(command.command, "woop", "boing")
	cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
	cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
	return cmd.Run()
}
</pre><p>Callers outside this package cannot construct a meaningful, non-zero instance
of <code>SafeCommand</code> because all 1 of its fields, <code>command</code>,
begins with a lower-case letter. In Go, identifiers that begin with lower-case
letters are visible only from inside the package.<p>Note that I removed the assertion <code>slices.Contains(SafeCommands,
command)</code>. Now we use the <code>SafeCommand</code> type to enforce that
commands are safe.<aside>Update 28 August 2023: Jacob Hoffman-Andrews pointed out that we could
even make the type private, by naming it <code>safeCommand</code>. But having a
public function that takes a private type feels weird to me. I slightly prefer
having the zero-value of <code>SafeCommand</code> be meaningless and hence
safe.</aside><p>From inside the package, it is still possible to create an arbitrary
<code>SafeCommand</code>. Depending on the situation, dynamic safety checking
may also still be necessary. Even if it is, I like the inherent
documentation-like quality of the new type name and the named global instances.
If you create a minimal package such that all callers are outside the package,
you may be able to leave the dynamic check out.<p>This way of doing things is a bit outside the Go cultural norm, but I hope
it‚Äôs not too far outside.<h2>Replace What Comments With Names</h2><p>Type names, variable names, function names, and so on (identifiers) are all
documentation. Many or most what comments are obviated by carefully chosen,
meaningful identifiers. This is the Javadoc problem: Most Javadoc tediously
repeats information that is already present in the identifiers themselves.<p>What comments are the most likely to get out of sync with the actual code,
which is often worse than not having comments at all. Readers easily get
confused as to whether the comment or the code is correct, especially in the
absence of tests.<p>I often see long functions broken up into sections headed with what comments.
It‚Äôs often better to replace the sections with calls to smaller (usually)
private functions that do the job, and whose names do the work of the what
comment.<p>Code full of what comments, like this:<pre>
func DownloadAndVerifyThing(path string) error {
	// Build the URL for the thing
	...

	// Fetch the URL
	...

	// Now verify the file
	...
}
</pre><p>can become:<pre>
func DownloadAndVerifyThing(path string) error {
	url := buildURL(path)
	pathname, err := fetchURL(url)
	if err != nil {
		return error
	}
	return verifyFile(pathname)
}

func buildURL(path string) *URL {
	return &amp;URL{
		...
	}
}

func fetchURL(u *URL) (string, error) {
	...
}

func verifyFile(pathname string) error {
	...
}
</pre><p>Now, <code>DownloadAndVerifyThing</code> is shorter, contains less state, and
is more obviously a composition of several tasks.<h2>Explain Why Thoroughly</h2><p>Depending on the situation, there may be many questions starting with ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù
that the reader of your code might have. Try to anticipate and answer them. Here
are some ideas:<ul><li>Why is it necessary?<li>Why is it implemented this way and not in some other way?<li>Why is it so complicated? Are all these special cases/fancy
algorithms/complex data structures necessary?<li>Why is it so simple? Don‚Äôt we need high efficiency/to handle more error
conditions/to be more generic/et c.?<li>Why is it here and not somewhere else?<li>Why is it important to fix/refactor/change/not change?</ul><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
