analyzed and characterized the bugs in the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
Catalog of 2023</a>:<blockquote><p>In 2021, the <a href=https://www.dhs.gov/cisa/cybersecurity-division>Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a>
began publishing the ‚Äú<a href=https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog>Known
Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog</a>.‚Äù Entries in this catalog are
vulnerabilities that have been reported through the <a href=https://www.cve.org/>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE¬Æ)</a>
program and are observed to be (or have been) actively exploited.</blockquote><p>I think this part in particular is important for software engineers and
management to be aware of:<blockquote><p>CISA recommends that organizations monitor the KEV catalog and
use its content to help prioritize remediation activities in their systems to
reduce the likelihood of compromise.</blockquote><p>Last year I did <a href=/2022/04/22/itw-taxonomy/>a similar thing</a> (see
also <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JeN3F8EG6A_ckb7PDCHIuAocR8W-6UEu9kKoctJaF08/edit#gid=1509787727">the
spreadsheet</a>), with a substantially different classification system but with
essentially the same outcome.<p>Hand-waving away the differences in the bug classification for a moment, we
see that MITRE got a similar result as I did: they got 46% memory unsafety (with
use-after-free (UAF) leading), while my (incomplete) result was 40% memory
unsafety. So we‚Äôre in the same ballpark, which is nice.<p>Of the various kinds of memory unsafety, why should UAF be so prominent in
known exploitation in 2023? My take is that for arbitrarily complex object
graphs, <a href=/2023/05/29/complexities-of-allocation/>nothing but
heap-walking garbage collection is reliable for achieving temporal safety</a>.
(GC; as opposed to less expensive lifetime management approaches like reference
counting, arena allocation, and so on.) Temporal safety is much harder in
general to fix efficiently than is spatial unsafety.<p>Moreover, browsers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich by definition must have complex object graphs (due
to for example the HTML DOM, JavaScript, and cross-process IPC with entangled
object lifetimes)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†are naturally a big focus of exploit developers‚Äô attention.
For efficiency reasons, browsers tend not to use GC for much of the browser‚Äôs
own internals. I think that accounts for the prominence of UAF in the 2023
catalog.<p>Let‚Äôs consider MITRE‚Äôs classification system, though.<h2>Taxonomic Tangles</h2><p>At its core, I find <a href=https://cwe.mitre.org/>the Common Weaknesses
Enumeration taxonomy</a> (CWE) to be trying for more precision than we can get
or even need, and that it obscures more than it enlightens. (<a href=/2022/07/10/fraught-vdbs/>I find the same is true of the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System</a> (CVSS).)<p>For example, consider the 2nd- and 3rd-most prevalent bug classes, <a href=https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html>CWE-122 heap-based buffer
overflow</a> and <a href=https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html>CWE-787 out-of-bounds
write</a>. It‚Äôs not immediately clear what the important differences between
these 2 taxa are. After reading their definitions, I find it even less clear.
Were the heap-overflows all reads, not writes? Were the OOB writes all on the
stack?<p>At the high level of analysis we are doing here‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat is, helping managers
and engineers allocate their time and attention most effectively‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†the read vs.
write distinction matters, but I‚Äôm not sure the heap vs. stack (vs. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss>BSS</a>) part is the biggest deal. It
matters to exploit developers, but the solutions look similar and have similar
costs to develop.<p>There is also a <a href=https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/788.html>CWE-788 access of memory
location after end of buffer</a> taxon. Where does that fit in?<p>This is important, because it might be that the 2nd- and 3rd-most significant
categories actually outrank UAF, if you treat them as essentially the same: as
spatial unsafety. That might significantly impact an engineering team‚Äôs
cost/benefit analysis: solving temporal safety is very hard (expensive), while
solving spatial safety is typically much easier (cheaper). Consider <a href=https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/lts_2023_08_02/absl/container/inlined_vector.h#L363>a
C++ <code>vector</code> type</a>:<pre>
// `InlinedVector::operator[](...)`
//
// Returns a `reference` to the `i`th element of the inlined vector.
reference operator[](size_type i) ABSL_ATTRIBUTE_LIFETIME_BOUND {
    <b>ABSL_HARDENING_ASSERT(i &lt; size());</b>
    return data()[i];
}
</pre><p>If the biggest security problem of 2023 can be solved by sprinkling 1 line of
code in the right places in core libraries, that‚Äôs a very different story than
if the biggest problem requires fancy allocation and deallocation strategies, as
solving UAF typically does. Allocation and deallocation necessarily have a much
greater impact on software efficiency and development cost than does the spatial
safety fix above.<p>Similarly, the 4th-biggest problem of 2023 in MITRE‚Äôs analysis is <a href=https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html>CWE-20 improper input
validation</a>. As defined, that could be a key contributing factor to all of
the other top 9 problems‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†and often is. (That
<code>ABSL_HARDENING_ASSERT</code> above is proper input validation, for
example.)<p>Along the same lines, type confusion (#8) could lead to spatial unsafety,
could be an exploitable outcome of UAF, and could be part of the exploitation of
deserialization of untrusted data (#6).<h2>Keep Calm And Engineer On</h2><p>Although CWE is Kind Of A Lot, MITRE‚Äôs analysis is, at a high level, correct
and useful in directing our work:<ol><li>memory unsafety is the biggest problem
(#1, #2, #3, and at least some of #4 and #8)<li>the next biggest class of problem is what I called <code>eval</code> bugs
(#5, #6, possibly #8)<li>after that, it‚Äôs all about what I called logic and configuration bugs (#7,
#9, #10)</ol><p>Our goal should be to get things to where logic and (rarely) configration
bugs are our biggest problems. To get there, we gotta hammer on memory unsafety
and <code>eval</code>.<p>Finally, if spatial unsafety really is the current biggest problem, that is
great news. Time to go write a bunch of 1-liners, and <a href=https://research.swtch.com/testing>write tests</a>! üôÇ<p>And, as I am reminded, turn all those pointers into <code>span</code>s.
