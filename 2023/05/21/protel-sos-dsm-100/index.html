Oriented Type Enforcing Language, and the operating system SOS (for the Digital
Multiplex Switch, DMS-100) that was built with it, give us an interesting
snapshot of the early history of software engineering (as opposed to
programming, and as opposed to computing science: programming integrated over
time). Naturally, my focus is on the safety affordances of the language, but the
Nortel engineers had a whole lot of modern design going on.<p>The language was in use starting in 1975, so it‚Äôs almost as old as C, and
also used for systems programming. It‚Äôs a familiar ALGOL derivative. The
official papers I could find (so far) are short and serve only to tantalize:<ul><li><a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/762490>Protel: a high level

University
Computer Museum</a>. Searching the web for some of the citations can get you
closer, but the holy grails that I haven‚Äôt found yet are H. Johnson, ‚ÄúPROTEL: A
programming Language for Large Real-Time Applications‚Äù (1984); and <i>Protel
Technical Notes, BNR, Language Development Group</i>; issues: vol. 1, nr. 1‚Ää‚Äì‚Ää7,
1980.<p>The broad view these sources provide of Protel and SOS is of a type-checked
and spatially memory-safe systems programming language, compiled into
dynamically linkable and swappable shared objects, which all run as real-time,
pre-emptively scheduled threads in a single shared address space.<p>The systems ran with volatile storage as their primary storage, rather than
treating volatile storage as a fast cache for non-volatile storage. Instead,
production systems had redundant power supplies and battery-backed power, and
used an explicit delineation of memory types for reliability and recovery.
Certain memories were explicitly temporary, while others would be restored from
disk or tape only in escalated outages. See <a href=https://messagepassing.blogspot.com/2008/12/what-is-sos.html>Clement,
especially ‚ÄúMultiple memory types‚Äù</a>.<p>Protel‚Äôs type system was somewhat richer than C; from Foxall, et al.:<blockquote><pre>
TYPE digit-value, terminal-id {0 TO 9}
    status_condition {busy, idle, blocked, ready},
    out_of_service BOOL,
    protocol_ptr PTR TO status_condition;

TYPE digit_register TABLE [0 TO 19] OF digit_value,
    special_feature SET {abbreviated_dial, add_on,
                  call_transfer, do_not_disturb},
    time_interval
       STRUCT
          amount {0 TO 255},
          unit {ten_ms, secs, mins, hours}
       ENDSTRUCT;
</pre></blockquote><p>I find ranged integers notable; <a href=https://github.com/google/integers/blob/main/ranged.h>even now, we have
to roll our own</a>, but I suspect their ergonomic definition could have
prevented many bugs.<p>Foxall, et al. describe descriptors:<blockquote>A descriptor consists of two parts: a descriptor part and a table
part. The descriptor part contains the table element count, the size of these
elements, and a pointer to the base of the table part. The table part contains
the elements of the current array. At execution time a descriptor may be made to
point at any table of the correct type. This results in modification of the
element count and pointer fields of the descriptor part.</blockquote><p>The area type seems to provide a form of abstract class inheritance via
C-<code>union</code>-like structured type punning:<blockquote><pre>
TYPE daddy AREA (6 * byte-width)
   i integer
ENDAREA;

TYPE son AREA REFINES daddy
   t TABLE [0 TO 15] OF BOOL
ENDAREA;

TYPE daughter AREA REFINES daddy
   j integer,
   k BOOL
ENDAREA;
</pre></blockquote><p>I don‚Äôt see discussion of down-casting safety with areas, though. As for C
<code>union</code>s and C++ without RTTI, areas may be unsafe.<p>Protel also had function types:<blockquote><pre>
TYPE get_channel PROC (terminal terminal_id)
     RETURNS integer;
TYPE transfer PROC (REF t time_interval,
     UPDATES feature_table DESC OF BOOL);
</pre></blockquote><h2>Early Modern Engineering</h2><p>Although that method of operation is different from what we use now, we can
see from these sources that Protel, SOS, and the DMS-100 embodied very early
forms of what we now consider a baseline for modern software engineering and
site reliability engineering culture. Some examples:<ul><li><p>A complete suite of language support tooling (the Protel Library System, PLS
and PLS-II), including <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System>a source code
control system (SCCS)</a>/software configuration management system (SCM). From
Cashin, et al.:<blockquote>In a production environment, however, the need for parallel support
of both old and new software is a fact of life. Therefore, a successor, PLS-II,
was designed to simplify the handling of multiple versions of both source code
and system structure. A tool called source manager, similar in spirit to SCCS
[DHM 78], is used to simplify maintenance and reduce storage for nearly
identical source versions. Compatible lineups of system versions are maintained
in the PLS database which refers to the named issues kept by source
manager.</blockquote><li><p>Recognition of interfaces as executable, enforceable documentation and
automated discovery of dependencies at compile- and run-time (Cashin, et al.,
‚ÄúInterfaces as Documentation‚Äù).<li><p>Technical structures aligned with social structures (‚ÄúModularity as a
Project Manager‚Äôs Tool‚Äù, Cashin et al.). This is perhaps more arguable and more
fluid, now.<li><p>Recognition of the need to ‚Äòshift bugs left‚Äô, preferably discovering them
during type-checking (Cashin, et al.):<blockquote>By performing strict type checking on intermodule references, we
have found that many of the errors which, in other languages, would have been
detected at run time are flagged by the compiler. This permits easy repair early
in the development process when bugs can be fixed cheaply.</blockquote><li><p>The familiar pain of long compilation times, exacerbated by thorough
type checking, in section ‚ÄúBuilding Systems‚Äù, Cashin et al. But: ‚ÄúWe feel that
the difficulty inherent in this process is preferable to the mammoth debugging
sessions which are required when analogous changes are made to programs written
in more loosely typed languages.‚Äù<li><p>Access control enforced by the type system (as seen in the JVM and the .NET
CLR, for example) (Cashin, et al.):<blockquote>We have found multiple interfaces to be an extremely useful concept.
They allow the separation of module functions by user. Thus, functions intended
for general users may be separated from those intended for more ‚Äòprivileged‚Äô
users. For example, a file system may have a general user interface which
supports operations such as <code>OPEN</code>, <code>CLOSE</code>,
<code>GET</code> and <code>PUT</code>. A second, more privileged, interface may
support operations which are only used by maintenance and audit
software.</blockquote><li><p>Dynamic configuration via function pointers (which Cashin, et al. call
‚Äúprocedure variables‚Äù; see ‚ÄúModularity
as a Tool for Flexible Configuration‚Äù). This includes the possibility of
selecting implementations at run-time:<blockquote>Since interface specifications allow a clear distinction between
what a module provides and how it provides it, it is possible to design a single
interface and several implementations for the same module. Any of these
implementations can then be used transparently in different system
configurations.</blockquote><li><p>Recognition of the complexity of dependency management, even in purely
1st-party codebases (see ‚ÄúType Transitivity‚Äù in Cashin, et al.).<li><p>An early form of <a href=https://semver.org/>semantic versioning</a>.
From ‚ÄúConfiguration Control‚Äù in Cashin, et al.:<blockquote>A version code consists of two parts: A major number that is
incremented when non-upwards compatible changes are made and a minor number
incremented when upwards compatible changes are made. Many, but by no means all,
interface changes are upwards compatible. The check used for consistency is as
follows: when a module is loaded, the major number of each module in its
<code>USES</code> list is compared with that of the version of the module
already existing in the system. If they are not equal, the configuration is
inconsistent. If they are, then compare the minor numbers. If the minor number
in the <code>USES</code> list is greater than that of an existing module then it
is possible that the module to be loaded relies on features not yet implemented
in the existing module and the configuration is inconsistent.</blockquote><li><p>Early understanding of <a href=https://www.hyrumslaw.com/>Hyrum‚Äôs
Law</a>. From Cashin, et al.: ‚ÄúAlthough implementation sections are hidden from
the outside world, there is a fundamental problem in ensuring that an
implementation change has not altered the semantics of the interface, even when
there is no direct change to the interface itself. The detailed implications of
changes to all users requires careful consideration which is not encouraged by
the knowledge that most changes really are well hidden and do not compromise
system integrity.‚Äù<li><p>The <code>DESC</code> (‚Äúdescriptor‚Äù) type was what we now call
<code>span</code> or <code>slice</code>: A pointer to a (sub-)region of
elements, together with the number of elements in that (sub-)region. This
provided spatial safety‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†the bounds were checked. They also recognized that
built-in mechanisms for safety can yield efficiency improvements. From
Clement:<blockquote>A Protel <code>DESC</code>riptor is used to refer to a range of
elements in an array of &lt;type>. It is used in the same way [as] an array‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith a subs[c]ript as an lvalue or rvalue to an expression (though the usual
meaning of those terms is confused by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protel#GAZINTA>the Gozinta
operator</a>!).
The compiler is aware of the of the slice being <code>DESC</code>ribed, and by
inference the size of the elements. In the storage allocated to the
<code>DESC</code> itself, it stores a pointer to the zeroth element and an
upperbound in terms of elements. In this way it can provide bounds checking on
accesses through the <code>DESC</code>. When an out-of-bounds exception is hit,
the actual upperbound and the supplied subscript are available in the exception
report, often allowing debugging straight from the trace. The array slice
abstraction can be a nice way to deal with zero-copy in a protocol
stack.</blockquote><p>Thus it would seem that Canadian telecommunications systems programming
language designers were, as usual, more polite than their cousins a little to
the south.<li><p>An A/B update scheme not entirely unlike what we now use in e.g. Android
and ChromiumOS; see <a href=https://messagepassing.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-is-sos-part-iii.html>the
‚ÄúOne Night(mare) Process‚Äù in Clement</a>.</ul><h2>Musings</h2><p>I used to think (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(operating_system)#Security_design>and
so did the designers of Microsoft‚Äôs Singularity operating system</a>, so at
least I was in good company) that language safety could obviate protected memory
(as mediated by a privileged supervisor). Clearly, the SOS designers were hoping
for that, too, and like the Singularity designers they really wanted to get rid
of the overhead of context switching and virtual memory. (The overhead is
amazingly high! We‚Äôve just come to accept it as normal, which really <a href=https://alexgaynor.net/2019/apr/21/modern-c++-wont-save-us/>puts
micro-performance concerns into perspective</a>.)<p>Similarly, <a href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2021/presentation/palmer>it‚Äôs
obvious (even to me) now</a> that memory protection alone can never suffice:
untrustworthy programs can call and corrupt a program even from outside its
protection zone (and even, of course, from other machines entirely). Add to that
side-channels and the practical difficulty of maximally reducing the privilege
of programs in real-world systems, and you have a recipe for sadness.<p>Having no memory protection does make language safety paramount‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†clearly, we
must have at least one of language safety and protected memory. But we also know
that there will always be unavoidable zones of language un-safety, even if they
are few and small. (Although it‚Äôs worth noting that, according to Foxall, et
al., ‚ÄúFurthermore, it was decided that PROTEL should be the only implementation
language‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno assembly language was provided for DMS-100.‚Äù) In the end, even
Singularity had to provide virtual memory protection. I do think, though, that
strong language safety provides trustworthiness that can allow us to reduce the
proliferation of memory protected address spaces, and hence to regain some
efficiency.<p>Here‚Äôs a simple example of scripting in the DMS-100 shell‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†it was still in
use at least as late as 2012:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6r151EuVlfQ title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay;
clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen loading=lazy></iframe><p>And, finally, your moment of Zen (Cashin, et al.):<blockquote>Rather than increasing complexity by allowing module nesting as in
ADA, our experience leads us to believe that even our current structure may be
more complex than necessary. Instead, it may be sufficient to have a structure
consisting of a linear chain of interface sections and a single implementation
section. This would increase the efficiency of the support system since symbolic
information would no longer need to be placed in implementation section object
files thus eliminating the need for a linker.</blockquote><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
