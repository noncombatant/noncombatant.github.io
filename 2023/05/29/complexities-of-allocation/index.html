affect the ergonomics of object lifetimes and the complexity of object graphs.
<i>Resource</i> generally means any or all of: memory, objects, files, locks,
sockets, et c.<p>Whenever a program requires complex object graphs, complex lifetimes, or
deterministic release of resources, but the language does not make those things
ergonomic to express, bugs will inevitably ensue. Examples include (but are not
limited to) trying to manage cyclic graphs with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization>RAII</a>
(e.g. classic HTML DOM and JavaScript binding implementations); any language
with explicit release (e.g. any C program that allocates on the heap, opens
files, or holds locks); and programs for which deterministic resource release is
critical to correctness but when automatic release is non-deterministic (e.g.
Java‚Äôs <code>finalize</code>).<p>The kinds of bugs you might ‚Äòenjoy‚Äô if your language cannot ergonomically
express the relationships between your resources vary according to the kinds of
resources you need to acquire and release. Examples:<dl><dt>memory<dd>Space inefficiency; use-after-free bugs<dt>locks<dd>Deadlocks; time inefficiency (holding a lock too long);
forgetting to release a lock<dt>files and handles<dd>File descriptor and handle exhaustion due to
keeping them open too long; data loss due to failing to synchronize a write
before program exit</dl><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/2016/01/30/everyone-needs-secure-usability/>Everyone
needs secure usability</a>, if we hope to consistently produce correct and safe
software.<p>For simple examples of what I mean by these strategies (except for GC, which
hopefully everyone is familiar with from experience in Go, Python, Java, et c.;
and global static analysis, which you can read about <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html>as it
is used in Rust</a>), see <a href=examples.cc>examples.cc</a>. These examples
use memory as the resource, but keep in mind the same idea applies to other
kinds of resources.<table><tr><th>Allocation Strategy<th>Brief Characterization<th>Ergonomic For Lifetimes<th>Ergonomic for Object Graph Complexities<th>Guarantee Of Resource Release<tr><td>caller acquires, caller releases implicitly<td>Static or stack storage, released on termination or <code>return</code>

Python, Go, et c.<td>any<td>arbitrary graph of objects of arbitrary lifetimes<td>non-deterministic; subject to leaks if program terminates before collection
completes<tr><td>anyone acquires, global static analysis ensures implicit release<td>Languages that statically analyze explicit and/or deduced lifetime
annotations that become part of an object‚Äôs type (see e.g. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_type_system#Linear_type_systems>linear
typing</a>).<td>inversely proportional to the complexity of entangled lifetimes<td>arbitrary graph of objects with references to objects of same or longer
lifetimes<td>typically deterministic when thread-local<sup>‚Ä†</sup></table><small><p>‚Ä† Although one can imagine implicit but non-deterministic release, I don‚Äôt
know of a language that has it in a static or stack-local context (but see GC).
RAII is the generalized form of these strategies.<p>‚Ä° Go‚Äôs <code>defer</code> is a special case: an explicit expression of
non-deterministic release.<p>Ôºä Arena acquisition and release (when resources acquired during a given
epoch are released together) can ease the difficulty that arises when objects of
different lifetimes become entangled in a graph. The costs are that resource
release within an arena might not be deterministic, and that some resources may
have longer lifetimes than strictly necessary.</small><aside><p>Thanks to David Adrian and Jon Callas for reading earlier drafts of this post
