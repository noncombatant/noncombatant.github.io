In this roughly-monthly newsletter I’ll recount wacky tales of what I’ve been up
to musically, and point to cool things other people have been up to that I’ve
discovered.<p>Please feel free to forward this to anyone who might be interested, and
please let me know if you’re no longer interested, and I’ll remove you from the
list.<p>The archive of all issues is <a href=https://noncombatant.org/adm/>available on the web</a>, of course.<h2>Adventures!</h2><p><strong>First,</strong> my latest adventure: I spent the first week of June
up in Vancouver building an electric guitar from scratch, with luthier <a href=http://www.meredithcoloma.com/>Meredith Coloma</a>. I posted a bit more
about it, including <a href=https://noncombatant.org/2016/06/12/building-guitar/>lots of pictures and
a sound sample</a>.<p><strong>Second,</strong> my band <a href=https://rarareplica.com/>Rara
Replica</a> was in the studio a few weekends back (and some months before that)
recording 5 new songs first with our friend <a href=http://www.camilolandau.com/>Camilo Landau</a> and then again with our
friend <a href=http://secretagentaudio.com/>Jamie Hill</a>. We shall release
these nü choonz in due time... (Katya’s and my previous band, <a href=https://dotpunto.bandcamp.com/>Dot Punto., also recorded 2 fine EPs with
Camilo and Jamie</a>.)<p>The <strong>third and final adventure in this issue</strong> is that <a href=https://noncombatant.bandcamp.com/>I’ve been releasing some electronic
music</a>. I half-compose, half-improvise these pieces on a sequencer app for
the iPad by pre-planning some sequences, and then record the audio as I tweak
the sequences in real time. They are a bit weird, but to me they have a nice
boop.<h2>Discoveries!</h2><p><strong>Composer and performer <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyondai_Braxton>Ty Braxton</a></strong> had
a great interview in <em>The Atlantic</em>: <a href=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/tyondai-braxton-hive-moogfest-battles-anthony-braxton/484646/>How
Tyondai Braxton Subverts and Destroys His Own Music</a>.<blockquote><strong>Braxton:</strong> I don’t think I can ever go back to
rock-based music, but I do know that I’ll always utilize guitar in some way, in
my orchestral music. The rock-band model for me at this point — I hesitate to make
a blanket statement, but it’s certainly not something that really interests me
right now.</blockquote><p>I got curious about <strong>Gregorian chant</strong>, and found <a href=http://imslp.org/wiki/Alleluja,_Magnificat_(Gregorian_Chant)>the Petrucci
music library</a>, which has freely-available scores for chant. Then I needed,
and found, a <a href=http://lphrc.org/Chant/>cool tutorial on how to read
ancient notation</a>. Liquescent neumes!<p>Finally, here are 2 videos of a <strong>great drummer, Dana
Hawkins</strong>:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1_t1Cq2wcg frameborder=0 allowfullscreen loading=lazy></iframe>

feature ’em in the next issue.<p>--<br><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a></article></main><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the
