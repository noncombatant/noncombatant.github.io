is dangerous. In general, internet security is about pushing down the cost of
unnecessary losses and increasing the overall value of the network. This work is
done in the margins; in the big picture, the internet is a clear win. “Cyber”
alarmism is serving somebody — but not you.<p><strong>Redundancy and backup.</strong> Have a spare machine, a spare network
connection, a secondary email service, or whatever is most important to you.
Have a backup plan <em>that you have actually tested</em>. (For example, set up
your spares by restoring your backups on to them.) In case of any problem — loss, theft, hacking, fire, whatever — you will need a fresh system with minimal
disruption.<p><strong>Isolation and compartmentalization.</strong> Separate your different
sources of data, and separate your different activities. For example, separate
your work computing from your personal computing; separate your military secrets
from your iTunes; separate your digital audio workstation from the guest
computer in your lobby. To combine activities of different degrees of importance
onto one machine is unnecessarily risky, now that computers are so cheap.<p><strong>Keep it simple. Keep it updated.</strong> Stick with the <em>latest
stable version</em> of a <em>small number of programs</em> that you <em>really
need</em> from a <em>small number of well-established vendors</em>. If a
platform or app gets updates only rarely or if updating is hard, that is a
severe danger sign. (The current industry standard is that updates arrive
monthly and install in one or two clicks; expect updates to become more frequent
and easier as engineering improves.) Avoid ‘supplementing’ the platform with
software from third-party vendors: avoid plug-ins, extensions, and
pseudo-security utilities like anti-virus software or firewalls.<p><strong>Avoid complexity and distrust magic.</strong> Prefer tools you
understand and are comfortable with, whatever your level of understanding is.
Resist pressure to adopt complicated recipes, and reject claims like “Product X
will make you safe from Problem Y!”<p><strong>You might need a professional.</strong> You may have specialized
needs, a particularly acute threat model or dangerous threat actor, or be in
some crisis. In that case, a blog post is not going to be sufficient for you,
and you may need specialized advice/tools/techniques that only a professional
can provide.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is
