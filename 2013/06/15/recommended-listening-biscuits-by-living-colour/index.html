a lot of musical and stylistic risks, and almost never miss. Their
masterpiece, <em>Time’s Up</em>, is one of the greatest rock albums of all time,
but today I recommend <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuits_(EP)>the
Japanese import of <em>Biscuits</em></a>, an EP they released in the <em>Time’s
Up</em> era. (Be sure to get the Japanese import; the US release is wonderful
but the Japanese version has 9 more tracks.)<p>A treasure trove of B-sides, covers, and live
tracks, <em>Biscuits</em> documents this limit-ignoring, virtuosic, and soulful
band in one of their most creative phases. Living Colour always expand the
harmonic and melodic possibilities available in rock music, and listening to
their live tracks you can hear them spontaneously invent something new and
beautiful again and again.<p>There are some great Living Colour originals on <em>Biscuits</em>. Highlights
for me are the insane guitar and drum duet/breakdown in “Money Talks”, and the
live version of “Information Overload” which will bend your ear. Here is an
excerpt of the “<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer>Wintermute</a> going insane”
guitar intro:</p><audio controls><source src=information-overload-excerpt-live.mp3><a href=information-overload-excerpt-live.mp3>Download</a></audio><p>Living Colour has always done great covers, and <em>Biscuits</em> has some
true gems, like Pere Ubu’s “Final Solution” and an incredible rip on Talking
Heads’ “Memories Can’t Wait”. None of the covers are mere remakes; Living Colour
always shows a new dimension to an old song, and always renews a sense of wonder
about what music can make possible. My favorite cover from <em>Biscuits</em> is
Al Green’s “Love and Happiness”, because vocalist Corey Glover opens all the way
up and does the song true justice:</p><audio controls><source src=love-and-happiness-excerpt.mp3><a href=love-and-happiness-excerpt.mp3>Download</a></audio><p>As David Letterman said, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhMuGPMzvS8">“If this song don’t drop ya,
