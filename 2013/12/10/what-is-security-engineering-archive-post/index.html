posted at the Hackbright blog</a>, here it is.</em><p>As a Hackbright student or alumna, you probably plan to participate in
building the foundation of our shiny new automated world. (Thanks for
joining us! We need you.)<p>Software, firmware, and computing hardware underlie essentially all
aspects of our society  —  the <a href=http://www.edn.com/design/automotive/4423428/Toyota-s-killer-firmware--Bad-design-and-its-consequences>safety
systems in our cars</a> (and trains, and airplanes), our <a href=http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/09/technology/knight-expensive-computer-bug/>financial
system</a>, <a href=http://www.darkreading.com/management/stuxnet-expert-proposes-new-framework-fo/240160846>critical
infrastructure</a> like energy and water purification, our <a href=https://twitter.com/alexhern/status/402365655250644992/photo/1>healthcare
system</a>, and our <a href=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-03-27-ea-drm-is-a-failed-dead-end-strategy>culture</a>.
Even hand-crafted clothing is sold on <a href=http://www.etsy.com/>Etsy</a> and is made of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html?_r=0">cotton
spun by a robot</a>.<p>But it’s not enough that our infrastructure merely work. It has to work
well and reliably under all kinds of pressure: human error (operator  —  and
developer!), bad weather, bad luck, radio interference, hardware failure,
network outages, criminal malfeasance. Even war.<p>Security engineering requires adopting a new mindset, at once cautious
and conservative, yet also willing to calculate risks and experiment. Either
perspective on its own is not enough; we must be of two minds to
succeed.<p>Software security engineers are the professional pessimists who insist
that <a href=https://blog.twitter.com/2013/keeping-our-users-secure>Twitter must
encrypt and authenticate all its network traffic</a> even though it might
seem less important than, say, banking. (Ironically, we then <a href=http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/why-your-password-cant-have-symbols-or-be-longer-than-16-characters/>beg
and plead with banks to adopt security</a> at least as good as Twitter’s.)
We worry about <a href=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/leet08/tech/full_papers/king/king.pdf>how
impossible it is to audit the hardware which we have to assume is
safe</a>. <a href=http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/smart-tv-from-lg-phones-home-with-users-viewing-habits-usb-file-names/>Normal
people see a TV</a>, but we see <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescreen>Winston Smith’s
telescreen</a>. We are those annoying friends who remind their co-workers
that <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow>computers
cannot, in fact, correctly add two numbers together</a> (not without <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic>significant
help</a>, at least).<p>Software security engineers are the professional optimists who try to
make computers work safely in spite of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law>Murphy’s best
efforts</a>  — we will try to <a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/satan.pdf>program Satan’s
computer</a>. We dream of a world in which <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_driverless_car>robot
cars</a> tell each other only the truth about their position and speed. We
dream of a world in which credit card and ATM fraud is mere statistical
noise. We dream of a world in which <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzR7R6fBr00">your phone is really off
when you turn it off</a>, and which keeps your communications with your
doctor confidential when it is on.<p>We dream of a world in which <a href=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/drm-be-damned-how-to-protect-your-amazon-e-books-from-being-deleted/>books
cannot be burned</a>.<h2>Resources</h2><p>If you’re interested in security engineering (and I hope you are, even if
you don’t choose to make it your specialty), you can get involved at any
point in your career. One of the best ways to get started is  —  as
always  —  simply getting your hands dirty.<ul><li>Use <a href=https://www.wireshark.org/>Wireshark</a> to learn what is
happening on your network, and learn about the structure of network packets
and connections.<li>Use an <a href=http://portswigger.net/burp/proxy.html>HTTP proxy like
Burp</a> to learn what your browser is saying to web servers, and learn what
it takes to intercept encrypted communications.<li>Check out <a href=http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/>Michal Zalewski</a>’s
excellent <em><a href=https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Main>Browser Security
Handbook</a></em> to learn why, exactly, the nytimes.com web site cannot
read your Gmail. (Hopefully.)<li>If you’re interested in cryptography, an excellent beginning book is <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Engineering-Principles-Practical-Applications/dp/0470474246><em>Cryptography
Engineering</em></a> by Ferguson, Schneier, and Kohno.<li>It’s important and hilariously fun to learn the C programming language,
and to learn <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/0131774298>how
C programs can go so badly wrong</a>. <a href=http://lldb.llvm.org/tutorial.html>Get your hands dirty with a
debugger and disassembler</a>, and learn what the machine is really
doing.</ul><p>And, as always, find a <a href=http://www.baythreat.org/>good</a> <a href=http://ccc.de/>community</a> to <a href=http://infosecmentors.com/>learn with</a>. Or <a href=http://observationdeck.io9.com/help-fund-a-feminist-makerspace-in-seattle-1467872208>build
your own</a>!</article></main><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the
