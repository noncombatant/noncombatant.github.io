fan of the wide-ranging scope and single-track structure. I hope we all get
vaccinated in time to have the conference in person again next year. The
conference organizers did a great job making the virtual conference work as well
as possible, and the Slack was fun, but you know… nothing beats in-person
hooting in the hallway track.<p>I was super fortunate to have my talk proposal accepted. I spoke about <a href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2021/presentation/palmer>The
Limits Of Sandboxing, And Next Steps</a>, which is about my work on the Chrome
Platform Security Team the past few years. (If you want to read the slides, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U60ycn3iW5MOB_xJUc09fsS1KXY2i68m9eVJoG4loWk/edit#slide=id.gb726919370_0_12">the
original Google presentation</a> has all the speaker notes and working links to
citations. Spoiler Alert: the “next steps” are to adopt memory-safe
languages.<p>Alex Gaynor and I sort of collaborated to make the same point from 2
different perspectives. His presentation, <a href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2021/presentation/gaynor>Quantifying
Memory Unsafety And Reactions To It</a>, is a great synthesis of empirical data
and emotional realness. Likely the biggest difficulty we face in migrating away
from memory-unsafe languages is people’s emotional attachments to the status
quo. Change is hard.<p>As always, there were a whole bunch of high-quality talks this year. Some
stand-outs (in no particular order):<ul><li><a href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2021/presentation/starbird>Online
