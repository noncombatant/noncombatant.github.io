don‚Äôt use assembly language for everything is that the lack of constraints make
it too hard to use for everyday programming. Before <a href=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF><code>goto</code>
was considered harmful</a>, people wrote machine code that jumped all over the
place, and programmers had to maintain a mental model of the complete machine
state and the full implications of each jump‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†a recipe for bugs.<p>Then, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming>structured
programming</a> was introduced: structured languages still compiled down to
<code>goto</code>s (or arbitrary jumps), but the programmer could think in terms
of more limited jumps: <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code>/<code>case</code>,
<code>call</code>, <code>return</code>, <code>for</code>. These constrained
jumps are much easier to understand; for example, when you‚Äôre reading code, you
can know that <code>return</code> doesn‚Äôt return just anywhere. It returns only
to the caller, as identified by a pointer on the stack. Later, language
designers added additional constrained jumps like
<code>throw</code>/<code>catch</code>, and virtual function calls.<p>(<code>throw</code> is a little bit too <code>goto</code>-y for my taste,
since you can‚Äôt tell locally where the relevant <code>catch</code> block is. But
that‚Äôs a story for another time.)<p>A key innovation of C++ was to introduce <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization>RAII</a>,
which essentially ‚Äòpiggybacks‚Äô on the value of the stack and enriches it with a
lot more power. (The additional complexity is usually manageable, and worth it.)
It allows you extend the automatic memory management that the stack provides,
initializing and cleaning up complex resources instead of just primitive values
like integers and floats. You can automatically close open files, release
dynamic storage, and so on. And it‚Äôs deterministic.<p>But there was still the problem of the heap: a free-fire zone with no
constraints, riddled with memory leaks (heap resources allocated but never
released) and use-after-free bugs (heap resources re-used even after having been
released).<p>A key innovation of Rust has been to <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html>statically
constrain the lifetimes of heap resources</a>, enabling us to more completely
solve the worst remaining memory unsafety problem. (Previous solutions to the
heap lifetime problem were <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>dynamic</a>,
not static, and hence expensive in space and time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†as well as being
non-deterministic. These limitations reduce the applicability of
dynamically-managed languages to applications and environments where these costs
are affordable.)<p>And, of course, taming object lifetimes greatly eases the problem of safe,
efficient concurrency. Concurrency is the key to improving performance in modern
systems.<p>Beyond memory safety, Rust makes more use of typefulness than I typically see
in other mainstream languages in its niche. For example, Rust‚Äôs rich
<code>enum</code>s and pattern matching make it easier to write state machines,
<a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html>the
new type idiom</a> makes it easier to get additional type safety (and improves
the interface-as-documentation factor), and so on. You can work to get similar
benefits in other languages, but Rust‚Äôs syntactic mechanisms and idiomatic usage
create affordances for these easier patterns.<p>Another freeing constraint Rust has introduced has been to systematize and
automate dependency management: the Cargo package management system. Good
dependency management is a <a href=https://research.swtch.com/deps>monstrously
hard problem</a>. Any dependency management system, including manual or ad hoc
management, poses a variety of problems:<ul><li><b>Version conflicts:</b> Inevitably, the latest version of the foo package
has changed its API in such a way that it can‚Äôt interoperate with the bar
package. Now resolve these conflicts all up and down the dependency tree.
Fun!<li><b>Supply-chain security:</b> When you pull in a dependency, you must trust
the transitive closure of all the authors who have committed to that dependency
sub-tree. This includes not just the code and the programs you can build with
it, but build scripts themselves.<li><b>Micro- and even pico-dependencies:</b> The tendency to multiply the
previous 2 problems by creating <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd>extremely tiny</a>, <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even>single-use packages</a>.<li><b>Proliferation:</b> The tendency to multiply the previous 3 problems by
creating several packages that serve the same basic need, leading to a situation
in which effort solving the same problem is fragmented‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†including
documentation, training, code reviewer/auditor hours, and so on. (I call this
the ‚ÄúOccam‚Äôs Razor now has <a href=https://www.theonion.com/fuck-everything-were-doing-five-blades-1819584036>5
blades</a>‚Äù problem.)</ul><p>The NPM ecosystem provides the clearest modern illustration of these
problems. (See page 11 of <a href=https://octoverse.github.com/static/github-octoverse-2020-security-report.pdf>GitHub‚Äôs
report on security</a>, for example.)<p>However, for all of NPM‚Äôs problems, <b>at least it is a package management
system at all</b>! It‚Äôs easy to pick on NPM (or predecessors like <a href=https://www.cpan.org/>CPAN</a>, or <a href=https://ctan.org/>CTAN</a>,
or...), but even at its worst it‚Äôs a <b>huge improvement</b> over manually
managing dependencies (such as by manually vendoring them into your source tree,
or just telling the user to install such-and-such libraries before attempting to
compile).<p>Life is better with NPM, and with Rust‚Äôs Cargo, Go‚Äôs <code>go get</code>, and
so on. Even when they aren‚Äôt perfect yet, they provide a framework for
improvement, by constraining where dependencies come from and how we maintain
them.<p>But a lot of work is still necessary. As an example of a Nice Thing Indeed,
Cargo has this add-on package called <a href=https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-supply-chain>supply-chain</a>,
which will show you all the packages a given package depends on. It will also
estimate how many individual publishers author those dependencies. Here is what
happens when you run supply-chain on itself:<pre>
~/src/rust/cargo-supply-chain % <b>cargo supply-chain publishers</b>

The following crates will be ignored because they come from a local directory:
 - cargo-supply-chain

The `crates.io` cache was not found or it is invalid.
  Run `cargo supply-chain update` to generate it.

Fetching publisher info from crates.io
This will take roughly 2 seconds per crate due to API rate limits
Fetching data for "adler" (0/79)
[<i>77 items, including some surprising ones, elided...</i>]
Fetching data for "xattr" (78/79)

The following individuals can publish updates for your dependencies:

 1. alexcrichton via crates: flate2, wasm-bindgen-backend, wasi, bitflags, proc-macro2, wasm-bindgen-macro, wasm-bindgen, openssl-probe, unicode-xid, wasm-bindgen-macro-support, filetime, semver, tar, unicode-normalization, libc, js-sys, bumpalo, log, wasm-bindgen-shared, cfg-if, cc, web-sys
 [<i>55 authors elided...</i>]
 57. zesterer via crates: spin

Note: there may be outstanding publisher invitations. crates.io provides no way to list them.
Invitations are also impossible to revoke, and they never expire.
See https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/2868 for more info.

All members of the following teams can publish updates for your dependencies:

 1. "github:rustwasm:core" (https://github.com/rustwasm) via crates: web-sys, js-sys, wasm-bindgen-macro, wasm-bindgen-macro-support, wasm-bindgen-backend, wasm-bindgen, wasm-bindgen-shared
 2. "github:servo:cargo-publish" (https://github.com/servo) via crates: core-foundation-sys, percent-encoding, form_urlencoded, unicode-bidi, core-foundation, idna, url
 3. "github:servo:rust-url" (https://github.com/servo) via crates: percent-encoding, form_urlencoded, idna, url
 4. "github:rust-bus:maintainers" (https://github.com/rust-bus) via crates: security-framework-sys, security-framework, tinyvec
 5. "github:rust-lang-nursery:libs" (https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery) via crates: bitflags, log, lazy_static
 6. "github:serde-rs:owners" (https://github.com/serde-rs) via crates: serde_derive, serde, serde_json
 7. "github:rust-lang:libs" (https://github.com/rust-lang) via crates: libc, cfg-if
 8. "github:rust-lang-nursery:log-owners" (https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery) via crates: log
 9. "github:rust-random:maintainers" (https://github.com/rust-random) via crates: getrandom

Github teams are black boxes. It's impossible to get the member list without explicit permission.

~/src/rust/cargo-supply-chain % <b>cargo supply-chain update</b>
Note: this will download large amounts of data (approximately 250Mb).
On a slow network this will take a while.
</pre><p>Now, that‚Äôs a lot of dependencies by a lot of publishers whom I don‚Äôt know.
(Although it‚Äôs not automated, if you dig around you‚Äôll find that many of those
authors are well-established members of the Rust development team, so trusting
them is an easier sell.) Another bummer is that, when I built supply-chain, my
default <code>$CFLAGS</code> broke the build (<b>Update 18 Feb:</b> with an
almost certainly spurious and not security-relevant warning,
<code>-Wunused-macros</code>). (My flags are quite persnickety:
<code>-Weverything -Werror -std=c11</code>. Very little code builds with these
flags. üòá) Apparently, some of supply-chain‚Äôs own dependencies depend on C code.
Alas.<p>But that‚Äôs OK! Cargo provides a framework for working on these problems. Over
time, I‚Äôd like to see things move along these lines:<ul><li>Replace C/C++ dependencies with Rust, and reduce the use of
<code>unsafe</code>. This has been happening, and will continue to, over time.
(See <a href=https://github.com/rust-secure-code/safety-dance>the Safety Dance
project</a>, which is a focused on reducing the use of
<code>unsafe</code>.)<li>Coalesce the most common dependencies into a (semi-)official ‚Äòextended
<code>std</code>‚Äô, so that they can appear as a single dependency with a single
publishing team. This is controversial in some communities, but I think it would
go a long way toward reducing the problems.<li>Obviate some of the micro-dependencies by folding them into larger, more
general packages including the language itself, <code>std</code>, and ‚Äòextended
<code>std</code>‚Äô (where and if appropriate). This is also sometimes
controversial, but again I think it would help.<li>Perhaps supply-chain, check, clippy, or a new tool could provide some
indication of a package‚Äôs reputation or something like what the Perl community
jokingly calls <a href=https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Kwalitee>kwalitee</a>:
Not quality, but overall ‚Äòsmells‚Äô. Good test coverage? Is the package version
greater than 1.0? Actively maintained? Frequently used? Maintained by the same
people for a long time? A low proportion of lines of code in <code>unsafe</code>
blocks, or in C/C++/assembly? Some of these things can be more or less
automatically determined, and tooling could flag packages that stand out.<aside>Fun update: Such a thing exists, and is called <a href=https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev/>crev</a>. Awesome!</aside></ul><p>Another good thing about Rust is its friendly community. Not all systems
programming communities are as welcoming as Rust‚Äôs is. Rust, and some other
communities, have taken <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct>proactive steps to
maintain a healthy community</a>. I think it‚Äôs fair to say the Rust community is
doing relatively well, especially in the systems programming niche.<p>Like all language communities, whether of natural languages or artificial
languages, the community and the body of literature and the oral tradition are
what matter. In its niche, Rust looks like the option with the most momentum
around a more positive, healthier community. The community and the language are
probably not perfect‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänothing is, if perfect is even a thing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää¬†but Rust looks
like the community most open to solving its problems, and most capable of
solving systems programming problems.<aside><p>Thanks to Adrian Taylor for reminding me to mention typefulness, concurrency,
and Safety Dance.<p>Thanks to Sergey Davidoff, supply-chain maintainer, for pointing me at crev
and noting that Safety Dance is more about reducing <code>unsafe</code> than
C.</aside><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is
