is known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory>an “L”
transformation in neo-Riemannian theory</a>. TIL! Every so often, the internet
actually delivers on its promise. 🤓🥳</aside><p>The other day I discovered a fun harmonic game. It’s a bit like <a href=https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chord-progressions/line-cliches/>the
line cliché</a>, but (I think) a bit more challenging. Here are the rules:<ol><li>Use only the 4 basic triads (major, minor, augmented, diminished). Start
with any triad.<li>To get the next triad, move only 1 note of the chord up or down 1 half
step.<li>Each chord change must change its root. (For example, E major → E minor is
not allowed. Don’t cheat by using enharmonic names! 😉)</ol><p>That’s it! It’s simple, but the limitations are tight. I find it’s a bit hard
to end up with a progression that works, but you can surprise yourself, and
perhaps come up with something you would not have otherwise.<p>You can make it significantly easier and generate richer changes by removing
rule 1 or rule 3.<p>Here are some ideas I like. (Note that example 🄱 breaks rule 3.)</p><iframe src="2021-09-30 Study.pdf" loading=lazy></iframe><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
