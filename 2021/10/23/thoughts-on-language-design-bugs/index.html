and colleagues have asked me, on the topic of programming language security. If
you’ve read anything else I’ve written, you know I believe the 2nd-biggest
software security engineering problem is the unsafety of C and C++. What that
implies and what to do about it is not necessarily obvious. So here are some
lightly paraphrased questions, and my general thoughts.<p>(The 1st-biggest problem is all about human factors: abuse, phishing, and
accessibility.)<div id=toc></div><h2>Is JavaScript Memory-Unsafe?</h2><blockquote>Why do you call JS and Python ‘safer’? Since (e.g.) JavaScript is
implemented in C++, doesn’t that make it just as memory-unsafe as
C/C++?</blockquote><p>Yes — and no. The kernels of the implementations of languages like Python,
JavaScript (JS), and Java are typically in C/C++ and they certainly do exhibit
memory unsafety and other C/C++ undefined behavior (UB) bugs. (Memory unsafety
is a subclass of UB.) However, these languages intend to limit UB as part of
their interface or contract. Minimizing or eliminating memory unsafety is a
design goal.<p>Thus, crucially, UB bugs in these languages are <b>implementation bugs</b>.
The (e.g. Python) developers fix them once, and then everyone benefits from the
implementation getting closer to the interface semantics. The implementation can
inch closer to the ideal of the interface, and the community can adopt the
improvement at scale.<p>In C/C++, by contrast, UB is considered <b>a design ‘feature’, not a bug</b>.
The language design committees and compiler developers won’t fix such bugs. Even
brand new features in C++ introduce new UB — it’s not considered a historical
mistake to be corrected.<p>It might seem like Python, JS, et c. are safe wrappers around unsafe code.
And they can be, and (depending on the specific implementation) more or less
are. For example, if an application implemented in Python is successfully
attacked, it’s much more likely to have been from a bug in the application logic
than from a use-after-free or a buffer overflow in a list comprehension or other
core Python feature.<p>Thus, a safe language implemented in an unsafe language might be OK, to the
extent that we can scale up fixing the errors in the implementation. But that’s
highly variable, as the next question raises.<h2>What’s Happening With JavaScript Security?</h2><blockquote>What about the fairly rough time JS implementations are having? They
don’t seem to be getting incrementally closer to the interface
ideal.</blockquote><p>Yes, this is a notable problem. I think there are a few reasons the problem
exists, and is apparent.<p>JS implementations are quite complex and large. Any large body of C/C++ code
is going to have a lot of problems. By contrast, the implementations of (say)
Lua and Self are notably concise, and Python is large but not huge. (And a good
chunk of Python’s size is auto-generated code.) If we assume roughly equivalent
bug-density per line across developers — in general we have no reason to assume
otherwise — less code means fewer bugs.<p>Additionally, defensive and offensive security research teams are hunting
night and day, en masse and at scale, for bugs in JS implementations
specifically. If another language suddenly grew to equivalent prominence, it
might face similar scrutiny and perhaps the known bug count would go up.<p>But there is a 3rd critical issue: Many of the bugs affecting JS
implementations are not vanilla C/C++ UB implementation bugs. For Reasons, JS
happens to face fairly intense scrutiny on raw micro-performance, which
typically leads developers to cut corners on correctness. (That’s the usual
justification for C/C++’s UB, too. Such an extreme performance focus can make
sense in some circumstances, but in the vast majority of cases it’s the wrong
trade-off.)<p>As part of achieving high performance, JS engines typically include several
different run-time compilers (just-in-time or JIT compilers) to transform the
code at run-time into a faster form. To build not 1 but several such systems
into your language implementation is a significant and complex undertaking
— especially when the pressure is on to go fast and save battery life on
people’s phones.<p>For example, JS implementations often have JIT optimization bugs that go
something like this: “We thought we could optimize by removing this dynamic type
check, because we thought we had a solid argument that the object is guaranteed
to be of type <code>T</code>. But, we were wrong.” (This kind of thing is quite
hard to get right.) And then the JIT emits memory-unsafe object code due to
erroneous assumptions during compilation. This class of bug is not due directly
or uniquely to C/C++.<h2>Why Don’t We Rewrite Everything In Safer Languages?</h2><blockquote>Given that C/C++ UB creates so many problems — causing the
implementations of languages to not live up to their designs — why aren’t the
likes of Python and other languages being rewritten in memory-safe
languages?</blockquote><p>First, because it’s expensive to do that. There are whole teams working hard
to make it less expensive to transition large codebases from C/C++ to modern
languages, but it’s just not a cheap or easy thing to do yet. Whether it is
possible to make it cheap enough at all is an open research question. Whether or
not it succeeds, I hope that the work being done now, in several organizations,
is made public. Even negative results would be hugely useful.<p>Additionally, separate from C/C++ UB, there exists a claim that developers
would just as likely make the same JIT compiler logic errors in a safer language
as they do in C/C++. In switching to a safer language, you would get rid of the
‘simple’ or direct UB and memory-unsafety problems, but JIT compilers would
still be difficult.<p>I hypothesize that some such compiler and interpreter logic bugs can be
approached as type errors and state machine transition errors, and thus
automatically detected and prevented by the implementation language’s own type
semantics. (For example, consider a bug where it should never have been possible
to move from state 1 to state 2 with an object of type <code>T1</code>, only
with a <code>T2</code>. This is known as <a href=https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/>the typestate pattern</a>, and
it might help with certain of the problems that dynamic language run-times
face.)<h3>Micro-Performance vs Correctness: An Ecosystem Problem</h3><p>To a significant extent, though, the semantics of JS, Lua, and Python are
highly dynamic — and that means there’s an inherent tension between the run-time
cost of dynamic correctness checks vs. raw micro-performance. Dynamism is an
awesome feature, but it comes at the cost of some machine-level performance.<p>I believe the right approach to this trade-off is to focus on
macro-performance, and to stop worrying about micro-performance for a while.<p>(At an absolute level, the micro-performance of modern JS engines is
absolutely stunningly awesome. Part of the reason we are having these problems
is that the developers of these engines have already done the impossible 10
times over, and now they’re looking for some 11th win. And, who knows... they’re
so good at what they do, they might very well find it. JS engine developers have
effectively solved the micro-performance problem of dynamic languages. It’s
impossible to understate the excellence of that — in part because it makes safer
languages that much more applicable and deployable! So we should all thank
performance-oriented engineers for this safety.)<p>What’s wrong with JS performance — why some pages or apps make your phone
warm — no longer has much to do with whether we do or don’t elide a dynamic
correctness check. It’s all about JS ecosystem problems.<ul><li><p>Your favorite news site pulls in garbage from Outbrain or whomever. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion>Transclusion</a> is a key
(beautiful) feature of the web, but page authors often transclude content
developed by maniacs who have no concern for the performance and reputation of
the transcluder.<p>To address this problem, <a href=https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/05/heavy-ad-interventions>some
browsers do enforce limits on 3rd-party resource consumption</a>, but they are
too generous. These interventions require the browser to be able to recognize 3P
resources as such, which is not always possible. A common practice on the web is
to pull the 3rd-party content into the first party itself: what should be
<code>&lt;iframe src="https://ads.com/ad">&lt;/iframe></code> becomes
<code>&lt;script src="https://ads.com/ad">&lt;/script></code>. At that
point, the browser can’t reliably recognize the 3P script as 3P, and thus to
impose limits on its performance and functionality would be even more
contentious than it already is.<li><p>The JS standard library is too small, and that encourages the development of
<a href=https://www.npmjs.com/>an oversized and intensely interdependent
contingent ecosystem of 3rd-party modules</a> to provide genuinely missing, but
also trivial or <a href=https://philipwalton.com/articles/loading-polyfills-only-when-needed/>unnecessary</a>,
functionality. These modules are not always implemented to the standards of
quality that we expect in a modern language’s standard library. And they’re
interdependent: if you pull in 1 module to do 1 thing, it might likely pull in
many of its own transitive dependencies.<p>Many web pages include many of these modules, which increases the amount of
JS code that needs to be sent to your browser and then parsed, compiled, and
executed. <a href=https://infrequently.org/2018/09/the-developer-experience-bait-and-switch/>The
size of web pages has been growing quickly</a>, and of all bytes in a web page,
JS bytes are the most expensive.<li><p>JIT compilation is a valiant and often successful approach to improving time
efficiency, but it has trade-offs that can be significant. Transforming code to
be faster takes time. The faster you want the code to be, the more analysis the
JIT compiler has to do, and that takes more time and power. Additionally, the
JIT compiler has to store the newly-transformed code somewhere, and that takes
up precious memory. On top of that, using more memory can sometimes incur a time
penalty, too.<p>So in some cases, the net effect of JIT can be negative; in other cases, it’s
worth it but expensive. If you turn off JIT compilation, you can potentially
improve correctness and security (no JIT → no JIT bugs), and you might not
notice a performance penalty. (See <a href=https://microsoftedge.github.io/edgevr/posts/Super-Duper-Secure-Mode/>turning
off JIT in Edge</a>, and <a href=https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting>in
Chrome</a>. Note that you will possibly see a compatibility penalty: pages that
use WebAssembly won’t work in JITless mode.)<p>This too is an ecosystem problem. If, hypothetically, 1 JS implementation
were to unilaterally take a less aggressive approach to JIT compilation (for
example, only doing JIT compilation after observing strong signals that it is
really necessary, rather than doing it eagerly), the tech press and competing
firms would publish misleading micro-benchmarks showing that in certain
circumstances other JS implementations ran ‘faster’. Even if the total system
performance that people actually experience (including heat, battery life,
memory consumption, other applications starving for resources, et c.) improved
under the ‘gentle JIT’ policy, it might not be tenable (or, at least not easy)
to ship under existing market(ing) conditions.</ul><h2>So What Are We Supposed To Do?</h2><p>Given that we are drowning in the personal, ecosystem, and political
consequences of C/C++ UB bugs and vulnerabilities, but that reimplementing is
expensive and difficult, what in the actual shit are we supposed to do right now
with the systems we depend on?<p>First and foremost, as a matter of professional ethics and responsibility, no
green-field development must be done in unsafe languages. The behind-the-curve
technology of the 1970s has not enabled and will not enable us to meet the
requirements of the 2020s and 2030s. We have to put a lot of work into working
around its problems, as I describe below, and we have to enter into that effort
knowing that it is all repair work and not new advancement.<p>Complementarily, we must do everything we can to minimize the amount of
maintenance and development we do in unsafe languages. That means gradually
migrating old code to safer languages, developing the new features of existing
systems in safer languages, replacing or removing components implemented in
unsafe languages, and so on.<p>In the limited and blocked-off area of maintenance and development in unsafe
code, there is actually a lot we can do to improve things. First, take the
micro-performance heat off by exploring solutions to the macro-performance
problems, whatever they might be. (Look for amplifiers at the application level.
Does 1 click incur 100 requests or operations?) When the micro-heat is off, you
can breathe a little and start looking into correctness and security.<p>Keep testing. Incentivize testing and bug finding. More. Incentivize fixing
bugs, polish, quality. More. It must be possible to get promoted to and
compensated at a high level for measurably improving code quality, instead of
shipping new features. It does sometimes happen, but overall most software
development organizations need a significant culture change.<p>Although C/C++ cannot be ‘fixed’, there is quite a bit we can do to minimize
and avoid the problems of these languages.<ul><li><p>Ignore and replace the standard libraries. They are riddled with historical
and recent design bugs. Fortunately, alternatives exist: for example, you can <a href=https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/base/options.h#L211>harden
Abseil</a>, and/or write your own replacements that prioritize your
requirements. It’s sad that we have to do this, but we do.<p>On the bright side, we stand to gain a lot of efficiency <b>and</b>
correctness <b>and</b> ergonomics — the standard libraries leave us in the rare
position of not necessarily having to trade these things off. Take this
opportunity! Abseil did, and it’s great.<p>From an ecosystem perspective, it would be much better if the correctness-
and safety-interested C++ communities rallied around a few new API designs and
new implementations: a new standard built to modern expectations.<li><p>Paper over the core language semantic problems to the extent possible. You
can do this with non-standard compiler flags: turn on bounds-checking for
arrays, turn on Undefined Behavior Sanitizer in trapping mode in production, and
turn on all compiler warnings and actually think about them. (Even the annoying
ones can point to real bugs — yes, even <code>-Wpadded</code>.)<p>Create new types to replace the built-in types. (Many people have made their
own integers, for example; here’s <a href=https://github.com/Google/integers>my start at a run at the integer
semantics problem</a>. I include pointers to several other designs on the idea.
I don’t claim mine is perfect, but I do think some form of integer improvement
is critical.)<li><p>Push the type system as far as you can, to assert correctness. C++ might not
have as fancy a type system as Haskell or Rust, but it is flexible, and you can
establish new patterns and helper libraries to get a more ergonomic experience.
For example, you could certainly implement the typestate pattern, or traits, or
spiffier <code>enum</code>s (<code>enum class</code> exists!) in C++. It might
require establishing new idioms, but, we can do that. It’s a lot cheaper than
reimplementing everything, and it might make gradual migration and
interoperability easier, too.</ul><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
