sufficient, and/or affordable. (<a href=https://www.securityweek.com/cost-sandboxing-prompts-shift-memory-safe-languages-little-too-late>Here
is an example from Security Week</a>, although this is not the only
instance.)<p>As the lead of Chrome’s sandboxing team and as co-lead of Chrome’s memory
safety efforts, perhaps I can clarify a little.<p>As I said in <a href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2021/presentation/palmer>my
Enigma presentation</a> (<a href=https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/enigma2021_slides_palmer.pdf>slide
7</a>), “good sandboxing is table stakes.” I reiterated this point in <a href=/2021/04/09/prioritizing-memory-safety-migrations/>my previous post</a>
(“if [...] your application is not making use of process sandboxing, consider
exploring that first before starting a rewrite effort”).<p>Contrary to what the Security Week article and some Twitter discourse
suggest, <b>sandboxing and memory safety are complementary techniques</b>, and
both are necessary.<dl><dt><b>Sandboxing reduces the severity of bugs.</b><dd><p>Sandboxing isolates code away from system resources and application
resources, reducing the damage that compromise can do. (Sandboxing also has
certain efficiency advantages, as well as disadvantages, too.)<p>However, a certain amount of attack surface will always be available from
within a sandbox, and memory unsafety (and other bugs) can enable an attacker to
get at it.<p>So you still need to get rid of as many bugs inside the sandbox as
possible.<dt><b>Memory safety reduces the number of bugs.</b><dd><p>As discussed at Enigma and in my previous post, very many bugs, including an
overwhelming majority of the vulnerabilities we know about right now, are due to
memory unsafety. It helps to get rid of as many of those as possible.<p>However, memory safety can’t constrain access to system resources, including
the file system, system calls, et c.<p>So you still need sandboxing.</dl><p>There are 2 key ways that Chromium (specifically) is nearing the limits of
how much sandboxing we can do right now:<ul><li>Our unit of isolation, the process, is expensive in time and space on some
(not all) platforms.<li>Some operating systems do not provide sufficiently fine-grained mechanisms
to allow us to maximally constrain sandboxed processes. Things are improving,
but it’s an unavoidably slow process.</ul><p>I tried also to raise awareness that not all the applications that need
sandboxing are making use of it. I know of at least 1 organization that was
compromised because their server application did not sandbox a file format
parser (written in C), and allowed anyone on the internet to send input to it.
So, more developers need to do more sandboxing — <b>as an industry, we are nowhere
near the limits yet</b>.<p>We are still pursuing additional sandboxing in Chromium. It’s just that we
can see a limit to what’s possible <b>at the moment</b>. If OS developers give
us more of the primitives we want, we’ll jump right on them — as we always
have.<p>Finally, nobody knowledgeable, that I know of, has claimed or would claim
that eliminating 100% of memory unsafety bugs would also get rid of all
vulnerabilities. The claim — <a href=https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafety-and-security/>based
on repeated real-world experience and evidence</a> — is that memory unsafety
accounts for a large majority of vulnerabilities. There will still be bugs. Our
goal is to marginalize memory unsafety bugs, because they are currently our
worst observed problem.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
