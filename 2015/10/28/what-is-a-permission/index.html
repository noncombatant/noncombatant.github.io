choosers provide.</aside><p>Every application platform needs to decide on 1 or more <em>protection
mechanisms</em> to protect <em>principals</em> from each otherax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääydand thereby to
protect the <em>assets</em> that the principals operate on. (If you are
wondering what those words mean, start by reading the classic <a href=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs551/saltzer/>‚ÄúThe Protection Of
Information In Computer Systems‚Äù</a> by Saltzer and Schroeder.)<p>Of course, platforms don‚Äôt <em>need</em> to provide a protection mechanism; I
was being a bit hyperbolic in the previous paragraph. For example, DOS and Mac
OS Classic had no protection mechanisms. But, well, they‚Äôre dead, aren‚Äôt they?
It‚Äôs no coincidence: they are dead in part due to their lack of protection.<p>So, platforms need to provide some protection mechanism to be viable on the
modern internet. This includes <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform>the Open Web Platform</a>
(OWP). As a Chrome security engineer, I am obviously interested in what
protection mechanisms the OWP provides; as a Chrome secure usability engineer, I
am interested in how well people can understand and use those protection
mechanisms, and how we can improve their effectiveness and usability.<p>Most platforms, including the OWP, use a hybrid design in which more than 1
protection mechanism is at play. As we‚Äôll see, there are reasons for this.
However, the more mechanisms there are, the more complicated their interaction
and the more complicated the overall system. That complexity makes it more
difficult it is for the system‚Äôs designers, developers, and users to build
accurate mental models of the system.<p>Thus, we should like to have a ‚Äòpure‚Äô system: a system that uses a single,
solid, understandable protection mechanism. When that is not possible, the
system should strive to make 1 of the mechanisms primary, and use the other
mechanism(s) to bootstrap the primary mechanism.<p>In the context of the OWP, we want to understand what we call ‚Äòpermissions‚Äô:
special powers that the person browsing a web origin gives to that origin, such
as the ability to determine the person‚Äôs computer‚Äôs geolocation, to read and
upload a file from the computer‚Äôs local storage, to listen on the computer‚Äôs
microphone, and so on.<h2>Definitions</h2><p>A <em>permission</em> is a (possibly persistent, possibly ephemeral)
capability grant. Think of a <code>Permission</code> as a hypothetical abstract
superclass that the hypothetical subclasses <code>ObjectCapability</code> and
<code>SymbolicCapability</code> implement. I‚Äôll try to explain what I mean by
that in the rest of this post.<p>I use the term <em>capability</em> in the sense of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security>capability-based
protection mechanism</a> (as opposed to an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list>access
control
list-based protection mechanism</a>). (In other contexts ‚Äòcapability‚Äô can mean
other thingsax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääydnaming things remains a Hard Problem in computing science.)<p>The key features of capabilities are:<ul><li><strong>Unforgeability</strong>: A process cannot falsely claim to hold a
capability. The system will detect and reject false claims.<li><strong>Transferability</strong>: A process can (generally) pass a
capability on to another process. In some systems (‚Äòpure‚Äô capability systems),
this may be the only way any process ever gets any capabilities.<li><strong>Inherent authorization</strong>: A process that holds a capability
is <em>by that fact alone</em> known to be authorized to use the capability.<blockquote>In some systems, that is not true, or sometimes not true. <a href=http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2005/10/19/the-bypass-traverse-checking-or-is-it-the-change-notify-privilege.aspx>Windows
includes an option to re-check that the bearer of a capability is still
authorized on each access</a>. This setting is almost always disabledax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääydexcept
in Chrome‚Äôs sandboxed renderer processes! Weird but true.</blockquote><li><strong>Opacity</strong>: A capability is some kind of opaque referenceax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääydthe value of the reference has no special meaning to its holder. Different
processes holding the same capability might possibly have different opaque
representations of a reference to the same underlying object. (Compare e.g. a
pointer in C, on which the ++ operator is meaningful, to a POSIX file
descriptor.) Opacity and unforgeability are closely related but distinct.</ul><p>By contrast, <em>access control list</em>-based mechanisms have only
unforgeability. As an example, consider the POSIX file permissions model (which
is relatively simple, compared to e.g. Windows). For each file, there are 3
principals: the user-owner, the group-owner, and ‚Äòother‚Äô (all other principals).
Each principal has 0 or more of 3 access rights on the file: read, write, or
execute. Whenever a process tries to <code>open</code> the file, the operating
system kernel checks the process‚Äô principal (user ID and group ID) against the
file‚Äôs access control list.<pre>

</pre><p>which is kind of like transferability. But it‚Äôs better to read
transferability as meaning ‚Äútransference to a <em>specific</em> process or
principal‚Äù. And we can see that this is not possible with POSIX file
permissions:<pre>
$ <strong>grep nobody /etc/passwd</strong>
nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
$ <strong>chown nobody /Music/Thelonious\ Monk/Brilliant\ Corners/*</strong>

...
</pre><p>A good example of transferability is <a href=http://blog.varunajayasiri.com/passing-file-descriptors-between-processes-using-sendmsg-and-recvmsg>sending
a file descriptor from 1 process to another over a UNIX domain socket using
<code>sendmsg</code> and <code>recvmsg</code></a>.<h2>Prefer Capabilities Over ACLs</h2><p>On the web platform we would like to use a capability-based protection
mechanism to the greatest extent possible, rather than an ACL-based mechanism.
There are a few reasons for this.<h3>Capabilities Make For Good UX</h3><p>Capabilities are a good fit for a well-known secure UX pattern: the
<em>chooser</em>. An untrustworthy process (like a web renderer) can ask a
trustworthy process (like the browser) for a capability (say, a file descriptor
from which to read data to upload to the web origin). Only the trustworthy
process can grant it. The trustworthy process shows the person a chooser UX, the
person selects a file (or, no file), and the trustworthy process opens the file
and passes the descriptor to the untrustworthy process. The untrustworthy
process has no ambient authority, and the user gets an understandable,
empowering interface to selectively grant authority.<figure><img src=chooser-example.png loading=lazy width=852 height=679 alt="A screenshot of a file chooser"><figcaption>The return value of the file
chooser UX flow is, or should be, a file descriptor or other
capability.</figcaption></figure><p>Choosers can let people choose much more than just files and directories. A
chooser can return any kind of object. Everything that a computer program can
represent can be handled as an <em>object capability</em>: any kind of <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc781716(v=ws.10).aspx"><em>securable
object</em></a> that the operating system can process; any kind of function,
object, closure, or continuation.<p>Additionally, choosers can grant specific objects at a specific time in a
specific context. For example, maybe you would like to grant hangouts.google.com
access to the external USB camera just this once, not all the time. Choosers
make that easy; by contrast, setting an ACL on <code>/dev/camera</code> may turn
out to be a surprisingly broad grant.<h3>ACLs Can Make For Bad UX</h3><p>ACLs are a pain in the ass (a) generally; (b) especially when the principals
are complex (as web origins + Chrome profiles + people are); and (c) when the
principals are numerous (how many web origins do you visit? 90 billion per
day).<h3>Namespaces Are Ambient Authority</h3><p>The ambient namespace that most ACL-based mechanisms provide (e.g. the
filesystem, the namespace of named pipes on Windows, et c.) often turns out to
provide more information and authority to untrustworthy processes than the
person intended. For example, the pathnames themselves might give away
information, ACLs have a notable tendency to diverge from the intended
permission grant (because they impose a maintenance burden), et c.<p>Closing the gaps left open in ACL-based systems has proved difficult and
inelegant. (See e.g. <a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb625963.aspx>Windows integrity
levels</a>, or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux>SELinux</a>.)<blockquote>‚ÄúApplications can be designed to run at a low integrity level.
Protected Mode Internet Explorer is an example of a Windows Vista application
that is designed to run at low integrity. Applications at low integrity might
need folders in the file system where they can write temporary files or
application data. In the case of Protected Mode Internet Explorer, the Temporary
Internet File folder in the user‚Äôs profile is used. How can a low application
write to a file system folder? The folder must be assigned an explicit mandatory
label that permits write access from a low integrity process.‚Äùax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd<a href=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb625963.aspx>MSDN, ‚ÄúWindows
Integrity Mechanism Design‚Äù</a></blockquote><p>ACLs (especially highly <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc781716(v=ws.10).aspx">complex
ACLs like in Windows</a>) have proved to be hard to use. By contrast, choosers
are so easy to use they are now nearly invisibleax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääydeven engineers often don‚Äôt
realize how large of a problem they handily solve.<h2>Ephemeral vs. Persistent Capabilities</h2><p>Normally, ‚Äúcapability‚Äù means <em>object capability</em> (such as a POSIX file
descriptor, a Windows <code>HANDLE</code>, a Python object reference, et c.).
However, in the context of the web platform, we often need to persist
capabilities across instantiations of the principal. That is, different renderer
processes running the origin (https, www.example.com, 443) on behalf of profile
1 owned by chris@goatbeast.localdomain might all need to get a reference to the
same capability, even across browser restart or computer reboot.<p>For persistent capabilities, we need to persist a symbolic representation: a
<em>symbolic capability</em> instead of an object cap. (This is a limitation of
the memory persistence mechanisms in common operating systems, not of objects
caps themselves; see below.) There must be a way to bootstrap the symbolic cap
into an object cap. 1 way to do this is with an ACL, although ACLs are not
the only way to achieve this.<blockquote>Cryptographic capabilities are another form of symbolic cap that a
process can bootstrap into an object cap; for example, consider encrypted and
integrity protected HTTP cookies that store the session state. In effect, this
cookie is an opaque, transferable reference to the next continuation in the
sessionax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyda persistent capability that requires no ACL to bootstrap.ax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security#Sharing_of_capabilities_between_processes>Wikipedia,
‚ÄúCapability-based security‚Äù</a></blockquote><p>In Chrome, we persist capabilities as symbolic caps coupled with a simple
form of ACL. In this picture, the <strong>Hostname Pattern</strong> names a
(group of) origins, and the <strong>Behavior</strong> describes the access
grant.<figure><img src=permission-list.png width=555 height=357 loading=lazy alt="A screenshot of Chrome‚Äôs ACL for the Notifications API"><figcaption>This is
an ACL for persisted, symbolic capabilities to the browser‚Äôs Notifications
API.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, if we had <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)#Orthogonal_or_transparent_persistence>operating
systems that could persist the live object graphs of processes</a>, we wouldn‚Äôt
need the bootstrapping step, and we could have all object caps all the time.
When booting up, the operating system would resuscitate a live object graph from
non-volatile storage into working memory, and all object capabilities would be
live. That would be nice and fancy, but it‚Äôs not strictly necessary. ACLs can be
a perfectly good way to bootstrap capsax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd<em>if and only if bootstrapping is the
only action that uses ACLs</em>. (Consider the design of POSIX, which has both
<code>stat</code> and <code>fstat</code>, <code>open</code> and
<code>openat</code>, <code>unlink</code> but not <code>funlink</code>, and so
on. It would be betterax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääyd‚Äúmore cappy‚Äùax‚Ääyb‚Äîcx‚Ääydif POSIX provided only
<code>openat</code>, <code>fstat</code>, <code>funlink</code>, and so on.) For
example, all sorts of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use>time-of-check/time-of-use</a>
(TOCTOU) and other vulnerable race conditions are a direct result of operations
on file pathnames (symbolic capabilities) rather than on file descriptors (live
object capabilities).<h2>Therefore</h2><p>Hybrid ACL/cap platforms should strive to use only object capabilities
wherever possible. Where persistence is necessary, we should persist symbolic
capabilities and ACLs which we use only to bootstrap live object caps.<h2>Stay Tuned</h2><p>I‚Äôve got a draft half-written that talks about a few other protection
mechanisms, and their engineering trade-offs.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
