Extension for HTTP</a> (HPKP). Thanks to my colleagues Ryan Sleevi, Adam
Langley, and Chris Evans for coming up with the idea; and thanks to Ryan and
Chris E. for helping me write the many drafts that preceded the final RFC.
Thanks also to the many IETF participants who commented on the drafts and helped
shepherd the document through to RFC status.<h2>What Is Pinning, And What Does It Solve?</h2><p>HPKP is an attempt to solve 1 of the big problems in the <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wpkops/charter/>Web PKI</a>: the fact
that essentially any certification authority (CA) or intermediate issuer can
issue end-entity (EE, or ‚Äúleaf‚Äù) certificates for essentially any web site. For
example, even though the certificate for mail.google.com is issued by ‚ÄúGoogle
Internet Authority G2‚Äù, which in turn is issued by the root CA ‚ÄúGeoTrust Global
CA‚Äù, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar>an obscure Dutch CA can
also try to issue certificates for mail.google.com</a>. So, we‚Äôd really like
some way to stop clients from having to trust such <em>misissued</em>
certificates.<figure><img src=certificate-viewer-mail.png alt="The Chrome Certificate
Viewer showing the mail.google.com issuance chain." width=227 height=279 loading=lazy><figcaption>The Chrome Certificate Viewer showing the
mail.google.com issuance chain.</figcaption></figure><p>Often, people propose to solve this problem by partitioning the web: either
they would like to configure their clients to trust only CAs from their own
nation; or they would like for CAs of nation <var>X</var> to be banned from
issuing certificates for organizations from nations <var>Y</var> and
<var>Z</var>; or both. There are a couple problems with this. Crucially, the Web
is World-Wide by nature and its many great benefits flow directly from that.
Additionally, it is not always clear what nation a given organization is really
‚Äòfrom‚Äô, and hence it is not always clear what CA ‚Äòshould‚Äô have issued the
organization‚Äôs certificates.<p>There can be no perfect set of ‚Äògolden roots‚Äô ‚Äî you cannot construct a
minimal set of issuing certificates whose operators are more certain than some
other set not to mis-issue (whether on purpose or by accident). If you partition
the web, you reduce its value without actually reducing the threat of
mis-issuance. So we need something else.<p>HPKP is 1 way to do that. HPKP enables a web server to tell clients (like
browsers) to expect the server to always present, in its X.509 certificate
chain, at least 1 of a set of public keys; and otherwise to to reject the
certificate chain. Thus, a web site operator can effectively reduce the set of
issuers that can issue for their site, without partitioning the web.<h2>How Does Pinning Work?</h2><p>To understand key pinning, first consider the classic simple case: SSH host
key management. When you first connect to an SSH server with a client that has
no previous knowledge of the server, you see this:<pre>
chris@goatbeast:~ $ <strong>ssh freebsd</strong>
The authenticity of host 'freebsd (10.0.0.4)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is b0:79:74:0f:58:20:80:fd:c7:47:33:d6:9c:40:df:20.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
</pre><p>My server, freebsd, is presenting its public key to the SSH client to prove
its identity. The problem is, my client has no knowledge of that
(<var>server-name</var>, <var>public-key</var>) pair. So it asks me to resolve
the confusion. I am supposed to perform some out-of-band check that the key
fingerprint is correct, and say Yes or No.<p>Assuming I say Yes, my client will henceforth expect this server to present
that key <em>and only that key</em>. If my server ever presents a different key
‚Äî whether due to legitimate key rotation or an actual network attack ‚Äî my client
will refuse to connect, and print a message like this:<pre>
No ECDSA host key is known for freebsd and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
</pre><p>The reason this works for SSH is that almost everyone who uses SSH is an
expert user: a systems administrator, devops engineer, or software engineer.
They understand the error message, know what to do in case of key verification
failure, and can act on it. The community of people who use any given server is
small. They can simply talk to each other: ‚ÄúHey, did you rotate the keys for the
server?‚Äù<p>But on the world-wide web, that won‚Äôt fly. Key rotation is common, we need a
friction-free introduction for that first connection, and the people using
browsers have no special knowledge of cryptographic authentication. Therefore,
we must still rely on CAs to provide the introductions, and we still use chains
of certificates to give us flexible continuity for our web servers‚Äô
cryptographic identities. And rather than pinning a <em>single</em> end-entity
key, as in SSH, we can pin a <em>set</em> of keys ‚Äî potentially at several
places in the certificate chain. As we‚Äôll see below, this can greatly increase
reliability.<p><a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7469#section-2.6>HPKP Pin
Validation</a> is essentially <em>set intersection</em>: given the set of public
keys in the signed certificate chain, are <em>any</em> of them the same as any
of the keys the server has asserted (‚Äúpinned‚Äù) as known-good? If so, Pin
Validation succeeds; if not, the client should behave like an SSH client: drop
the invalid connection. In Chrome, that looks like this:<figure><img src=pin-validation-failure.png alt="A screenshot of Chrome
rejecting an invalid pin set." width=421 height=328 loading=lazy><figcaption>Chrome rejecting an invalid pin
set.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do I Configure HPKP For My Site?</h2><blockquote><strong>WARNING:</strong> Public key pinning for web sites can be
very dangerous. If you make a mistake, you might cause clients to pin a set of
keys that validates today but which stops validating a week or a year from now,
if something changes. In that case, you‚Äôll end up denying service to your own
site! People won‚Äôt be able to connect. (We call this ‚Äúbricking your site‚Äù.)
Unless you are very confident that you understand the Web PKI, and unless you
are very confident that you can manage your site‚Äôs cryptographic identity very
well, you should not use key pinning. Stick to regular, un-pinned Web PKI until
you get more confident.</blockquote><p>There are several steps you have to take to pin 1 or more of the public keys
in your site‚Äôs certificate chain(s):<ol><li>Figure out your site‚Äôs certificate chain(s) <em>as served</em> and <em>as
validated by clients</em><li>Decide where in the chain(s) you‚Äôd like to pin<li>Set up 1 or more backup pins<li>Configure your (test) server to issue a short-lived HPKP header and test it
out<li>Gradually increase the lifetime of the pin set as you get more comfortable
with it</ol><p>In the following sections I‚Äôll describe how to do each step.<h3>Determine Your Site‚Äôs Certificate Chain(s)</h3><p>As we saw in the Certificate Viewer screenshot, a site‚Äôs certificate is at
the end of a chain of (usually) at least 3 certificates: the <em>root
certificate</em> or <em>trust anchor</em>, 1 or more <em>intermediate issuer
certificates</em>, and finally the <em>end-entity certificate</em>. Typically,
the web server must serve as part of its TLS handshake all of these certificates
except the root or trust anchor ‚Äî the client maintains a set of trust anchors
and finds 1 that signed the top-most intermediate. In certain cases, a server
can serve only its EE and the clients will discover the intermediate issuers,
but this often leads to trouble. Generally, expect to have to serve a chain
containing the intermediate issuer(s).<p>However, be aware that the chain you serve is not necessarily the chain that
clients will (re)build when validating the chain! This is due to
<em>cross-signing</em>, and the generally <a href=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6>surprisingly complicated way
in which clients build and validate certificate chains</a>. You can partially
control this by ensuring that you serve good chains with well-known intermediate
issuers that chain up to a single well-known trust anchor. Even so, you must
test with a variety of clients to make sure you know what chains clients will
really build and validate.<p>Crucially, clients perform Pin Validation on the chain they build during
chain validation, which is not necessarily the same as the chain you serve. So,
unfortunately, you can‚Äôt always simply pin the keys in the chain you serve and
be certain that Pin Validation will succeed. (Although see the next section for
ways to get better coverage.)<p>Some sites use a distinct EE certificate for each distinct server in a
cluster. Perhaps each EE is issued by the same issuers, but perhaps not. If not,
your situation is likely very complex and key pinning might not work for you.
(Or, it may only work with a very large pin set.)<h3>Decide What Keys To Pin</h3><p>Now that you have a grip on what certificate chain(s) clients will build and
validate, it‚Äôs time to decide where in that chain to pin. For the sake of
discussion, I‚Äôll assume a simple server deployment model:<ul><li>the organization has 2 data centers, each hosting a cluster of web servers<li>the organization obtains 1 EE certificate for 1 cluster, and another EE
certificate for the other cluster<li>the organization has the same CA issue both EEs<li>the CA issues through 1 intermediary</ul><p>Thus, we have 2 certificate chains in production: CA ‚Üí intermediary ‚Üí EE1,
and CA ‚Üí intermediary ‚Üí EE2. The servers in the 2 clusters are configured,
correctly, to serve the chains intermediary ‚Üí EE1 (for data center 1) and
intermediary ‚Üí EE2 (for DC 2).<p>Let‚Äôs further assume for simplicity that clients do indeed build a path
through the intermediary to the same CA certificate as we expect. (Again, in
reality, you <em>cannot simply assume this</em>.)<p>We can choose to pin the keys of any of the 4 certificates: CA, intermediary,
EE1, and EE2. The implications of pinning at different levels vary:<dl><dt>Pinning at the EE(s).<dd>This gives the site operator a security
guarantee as strong as SSH: any misissuance will cause clients to reject the
misissued chain. The downside is that the server operator ties themselves to
those specific EE public keys ‚Äî simply getting a new EE issued by the same
issuer(s) will not work (although see below about backup pins).<dt>Pinning at the intermediary/ies.<dd>This reduces the threat of
misissuance to only the pinned intermediary/ies ‚Äî a significant improvement over
the status quo, but not strictly as strong as pinning to only the EEs. By the
same token, any new certificate issued for the site by those issuers will pass
Pin Validation.<dt>Pinning at the root(s).<dd>This is similar to pinning to the
intermediary/ies. Often, the same organization controls the private keys of the
root and the intermediary/ies. If that is not the case, then this option becomes
different from pinning to intermediaries: the site operator now trusts more or
different private key holders not to misissue.</dl><p>By pinning at multiple levels in the certificate chain ‚Äî e.g. the EEs and the
intermediaries, the EEs and the root, the intermediaries and the root, or at all
3 ‚Äî the site operator can trade off trusting more issuers with greater ease of
avoiding bricking the site.<h3>Generate A Backup Pin</h3><p>The RFC mandates that hosts MUST provide a backup pin: A pin that is
<em>not</em> present in the chain that the client validates. This is for your
own good: if you lose control of your private keys and need to re-key your site
and get new certificates, you don‚Äôt want your site to have any down time ‚Äî and
certainly not to be bricked! Unless clients have already pinned your backup key,
your site would be bricked until the max-age timed out.<p>In this example, I‚Äôll use a backup EE certificate as a backup pin. (You
could, and likely should, also use an alternate intermediary or root issuer
certificate for your backup. Additionally, it is best to get your backup signed
by a valid issuer, <em>before</em> disaster strikes, so that you really can put
it into production at a moment‚Äôs notice!)<p>This script generates a new key and an associated certificate signing request
(CSR; which is what you would send to a CA for them to sign). This is a way to
generate a primary and/or backup EE key and CSR for your site. Again, the safest
thing to do is to actually get your backup key in a valid certificate issued by
a real issuer, so that you could put it into production immediately if
necessary.<pre>
#!/bin/sh

openssl genrsa -out "$1".key 2048
openssl req -new -key "$1".key -out "$1".csr
</pre><h3>Test The HPKP Header</h3><p>This script makes a key pin: it reads in either an X.509 certificate (in PEM
format) or a certificate signing request (also in PEM format), extracts its
subject public key info (SPKI) section, hashes the SPKI with SHA-256, and then
base 64-encodes that:<pre>
#!/bin/sh

type="x509"
case "$1" in
  x509)
    type="x509"
    ;;
  req)
    type="req"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 x509 certificate-pathname"
    echo "       $0 req certificate-signing-request-pathname"
    exit 1
esac

openssl $type -noout -in "$2" -pubkey | \
  openssl asn1parse -noout -inform pem -out public.key
openssl dgst -sha256 -binary public.key | openssl enc -base64
</pre><p>The output of this script is what you will put in your PKP headers. For
example, this is an example Apache header directive that I am currently using
for nonfreesoftware.org (lines folded to fit):<pre>
Header add Public-Key-Pins "max-age=500; includeSubDomains;
    pin-sha256=\"wBVXRiGdJMKG7vQhr9tZ9br9Md4l7cO69LF2a88Au/o=\";
    pin-sha256=\"fv1+PWVvrBGKldX8uRtODY3sDbBKlsJOa48mI9s+6Mk=\";
    pin-sha256=\"lT09gPUeQfbYrlxRtpsHrjDblj9Rpz+u7ajfCrg4qDM=\""
</pre><p>I‚Äôve pinned my end-entity, an issuer, and a backup key. I‚Äôve set the max-age
for 500 seconds, so that I can‚Äôt brick the site for very long. And, of course,
I‚Äôve pinned only an alternate name for the site, not the canonical name (which
is noncombatant.org).<p>Finally, check to make sure that your client has read and understood the key
pins. In this screenshot, you can see that Chrome has recognized my
Public-Key-Pins header:<figure><img src=hsts-internals.png alt="A view of
chrome://net-internals/#hsts showing key pins for nonfreesoftware.org" width=539 height=354 loading=lazy><figcaption>chrome://net-internals/#hsts allows you to query the
state of Chrome‚Äôs HSTS and HPKP database.</figcaption></figure><aside><p>Update 08 Mar 2017: A previous version of this post used the word
‚ÄòBalkanize‚Äô to mean ‚Äòpartition‚Äô. A nice reader took the time to email me to say
that the term is offensive to people from the Balkans ‚Äî¬†something that I admit I
had not realized or considered. I‚Äôve switched to using the term ‚Äòpartition‚Äô
instead. I apologize for that! And thanks to the helpful reader.</aside><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is
