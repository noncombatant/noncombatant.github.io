like this happens</a> (<a href=/2015/02/21/superfish-round-up/>...again</a>),
people start clamoring for public key pinning to ‚Äòsolve‚Äô the problem.<p>The core problem here is that, although the people who bought the computers
did not want a certificate installed that makes MITM attacks easy, the computer
vendors sold them that way anyway. The people who bought the computers did not,
in effect, really have full ownership of what they bought. Additionally, people
did not come to realize this until many months after the computers were sold!

Technica‚Äôs coverage</a>.)<p>People who want HPKP to solve the problem wish that, when setting public key
pins, servers should be able to expect clients to perform Pin Validation
unconditionally ‚Äî to <em>always</em> obey the server‚Äôs requirements, regardless
of the client‚Äôs configuration. Even, if necessary, taking priority over the
requirements of the client machine‚Äôs owner. This would be a weak form of Remote
Attestation. The goal, in this case, is to make things like the Superfish and
Dell certificates ineffective for use in attacks or mischief: the interloper
certificates just wouldn‚Äôt work, and would hence be discovered immediately.<p>However, it is not possible for a low-privilege application to defend against
the platform it runs on, if the platform is intent on undermining the
application‚Äôs expectations. To try would be futile, and would necessarily also
violate a crucial digital rights principle: The computer‚Äôs owner should get to
decide how the computer behaves. Dell and Lenovo let their customers down in
that way, but for better and for worse, it‚Äôs not something that a web browser
can fix.<p>Our idea when designing HPKP was to <a href=/2015/05/01/about-http-public-key-pinning/>allow a site to reduce the
number of issuers that can issue certificates for the site</a> ‚Äî assuming the
client is not already compromised. We assumed that because we must: as <a href=https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/security-faq>the Chromium
Security FAQ</a> and <a href=http://blogs.technet.com/b/rhalbheer/archive/2011/06/16/ten-immutable-laws-of-security-version-2-0.aspx>Microsoft‚Äôs
10 Immutable Laws Of Security</a> document, if a computer‚Äôs operating system is
compromised, there is nothing certain that a mere userland application ‚Äî which
must depend on the underlying layers, including the OS ‚Äî can do.<p>Specifically, browsers do not perform Pin Validation when the presented
certificate chain chains up to a locally-installed, ‚Äòprivate‚Äô, or ‚Äònon-system‚Äô
trust anchor. (Microsoft ships a standard set of trust anchors for the system,
but also enables the system‚Äôs administrators/owners to install additional, local
anchors.) There are 3 reasons for this:<ul><li>There are legitimate reasons to proxy TLS connections ‚Äî <a href=http://www.telerik.com/fiddler>not least of
which is debugging</a>.
Personally I am extremely skeptical of the value of AV/IDS/IPS/DLP proxies, but
some people use them on the computers they own. To them, that‚Äôs legitimate use,
too.<li>A user program cannot defend against software running at the same or a
higher level of privilege, and it is pointless to try. The effort will be either
entirely wasted, or will outweigh any marginal, temporary gains.<li>Computers should do what their owners want, or at least give the owner
priority over the desires of a remote server operator.</ul><p>All the same, people seem to wish that servers could say to clients, ‚ÄúHere
are my expected keys, and you should fail to connect to me if I seem to present
different keys, <em>even if the person who owns the computer wants to connect
anyway</em>.‚Äù That would be beneficial in that non-consensual proxying would be
exposed sooner and with somewhat more certainty. But if a server could get such
a guarantee, it could also be used in ways very much counter to the open
Internet we know and love. Thus, frankly, I‚Äôm glad that Remote Attestation is
impossible. (Or, if you prefer, so impractical and theoretical as to be
impossible for now.)<p>There are many, many ways in which the higher-privilege operating system or
other software can force the lower-privilege client program to connect through a
proxy, in spite of a hypothetical ‚Äòstrict‚Äô HPKP behavior. Here are a few
examples ‚Äî I don‚Äôt imagine this list is exhaustive:<ul><li>Installing a new trust anchor in the local store<li>Installing a new trust anchor in the system store<li>Injecting a DLL that overrides the usual Pin Validation and X.509 validation
code<li>Overwriting the application‚Äôs code on disk<li>Overwriting the application‚Äôs code in memory at run-time<li>Installing a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_Service_Provider>layered service
provider</a> (LSP)</ul><p>The ironic thing is that, if clients did implement the ‚Äòstrict‚Äô form of Pin
Validation, many of the same people who are now calling for it would either
resort to the above means to do their legitimate proxying, or would buy their
proxy software from someone who does.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is
