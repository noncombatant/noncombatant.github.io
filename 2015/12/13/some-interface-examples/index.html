interface design principles</a>, I sort of assumed that people would know what I
meant by ‚Äúprimary interface definition‚Äù. In <a href=/2014/08/10/security-as-a-class-of-interface-guarantee/>Security
As A
Class Of Interface Guarantee</a> I defined it it as follows:<blockquote>The <strong>primary interface definition</strong> is the immediately
accessible surface of the interface itself, e.g. a function or method
declaration, an IDL specification or other code generation/specification system
for network protocols, the grammar of a programming language, or a user-facing
GUI or CLI. A <strong>secondary interface definition</strong> is supplementary
material; usually documentation, annotation, post-facto errata, entries in issue
trackers, commit log messages, et c.</blockquote><p>Our ideal is, or should be, to make interfaces so simple to use that people
can learn them immediately, and use them readily. Additionally, it should be
impossible (or at least difficult) to use the interface unsafely. (‚ÄúUnsafety‚Äù
could mean whatever you like: deleting important information, not deleting
information that the person needs deleted, sending information to the wrong
person, not sending information to the right person, crashing the machine, and
so on.)<p>A learnable interface explains itself upon contact‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe person using it has
no need of secondary interface definitions such as documentation. Like a
screwdriver, the shape of the head either fits or does not fit the screw. If the
person somehow manages to crank the wrong screwdriver into a screw head, the
damage will be immediate, obvious, and commensurate with how hard the person
cranked it. (Unlike so much software that explodes silently, a week
later...)<figure><img src=screws.jpg alt="Picture of screwdrivers and their matching
screw heads." width=456 height=232 loading=lazy><figcaption>From <a href=http://universalscrewdriver.com/>Universal Screwdriver</a>. Maybe we can
make software interfaces more universal.</figcaption></figure><p>I also assumed people would know what it means for an interface to be as
simple as possible, but no simpler. For example, maybe the <a href=http://universalscrewdriver.com/>Universal
Screwdriver</a> really works‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut maybe it doesn‚Äôt. It seems unlikely to perfectly fit the different types of
screw heads. It‚Äôs worth a try, but we should fall back to regular screwdrivers
if necessary.<p>Here are 2 more examples. I am a fan of dialog boxes that really offer
choice, rather than the often meaningless <strong>OK</strong> and
<strong>Cancel</strong> ‚Äònon-dialog‚Äô boxes. Sometimes, those 2 choices are just
not enough to give the person what they need.<figure><img src=3-choice-2.png alt="Screenshot of 3 choices when deleting a
recurring calendar event: Only This Instance, All Following, and All Events In
The Series." width=755 height=253 loading=lazy><figcaption>Screenshot of
3 choices when deleting a recurring calendar event: <strong>Only This
Instance</strong>, <strong>All Following</strong>, and <strong>All Events In The
Series</strong>.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=3-choice-1.png alt="Screenshot of 3 choices when exiting a
text editor: Close Without Saving, Cancel, and Save As." width=714 height=559 loading=lazy><figcaption>Screenshot of 3 choices when exiting a

<strong>Save As</strong>.</figcaption></figure><p>The only way to simplify the calendar example would be to over-simplify it:
to remove meaningful choices. The safest choice, <strong>Only This
Instance</strong>, is first, followed by the still-pretty-safe <strong>All
Following</strong>. But <strong>All Events In The Series</strong> is sometimes
necessary. And of course, Google Calendar does offer <strong>Undo</strong>.<p>The text editor example could be simplified; for example, Mac OS X
TextEdit.app and Google Docs both constantly auto-save. They entirely get rid of
the concept of saving, which is great because people throughout the Cyber Age
have lost tons of work because they forgot to save. All that remains of the old
<strong>Save</strong>/<strong>Save As...</strong> paradigm is the
still-meaningful <strong>Export...</strong>, <strong>Rename...</strong>, and
<strong>Make A Copy...</strong>.<p>Note that auto-saving applications must either automatically name files (<a href=https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/MOSXAppProgrammingGuide/CoreAppDesign/CoreAppDesign.html>Mac
OS X</a>; see ‚ÄúThe Document Architecture Provides Many Capabilities for Free‚Äù),
or do away with the concept of the filesystem by replacing it with search
(Google Drive).<p>One could argue, as I probably would, that a programmer‚Äôs or engineer‚Äôs text
editor still needs a concept of <em>explicit commit</em>, and hence should not
auto-save or at least not auto-name. Therefore, such editors do still need to
raise a dialog if there are un-committed buffers on exit; given that, Gedit‚Äôs
3-choice dialog seems to fit people‚Äôs needs well. On the other hand, one could
argue that the revision control system (e.g. Git; ideally integrated into the
editor as in most IDEs) exists to provide explicit commit, and that the editor
could and hence should auto-save (possibly into a temporary, private branch in
the RCS). But it probably still could not auto-name.<p>Thus, even in the case of the engineer‚Äôs text editor, no further
simplification is possible. You can move the complexity around, creating 1
giant complex system (e.g. Eclipse) or integrating many small tools with
glue code (e.g. bash + vim + git), but you can‚Äôt eliminate it without losing
something crucial.<p>Although the examples so far have been of UIs, we can apply the same
interface design principles to APIs. APIs are, after all, UIs for engineers.
(The same is true of a programming language‚Äôs syntax, and the principles apply
there, too.) Consider the <code>get</code> method of the Java
<code>HashMap</code> class. From <a href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html#get(java.lang.Object)>the
documentation</a>:<blockquote><code>public V get(Object key)</code><p>Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map
contains no mapping for the key.<p>More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key k to a value v such
that (<code>key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k)</code>), then this method
returns v; otherwise it returns <code>null</code>. (There can be at most one
such mapping.)<p>A return value of <code>null</code> does not <em>necessarily</em> indicate
that the map contains no mapping for the key; it‚Äôs also possible that the map
explicitly maps the key to <code>null</code>. The <code>containsKey</code>
operation may be used to distinguish these two cases.<p><strong>Specified by:</strong><p><code>get</code> in interface <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code><p><strong>Overrides:</strong><p><code>get</code> in class <code>AbstractMap&lt;K,V&gt;</code><p><strong>Parameters:</strong><p>key - the key whose associated value is to be returned<p><strong>Returns:</strong><p>the value to which the specified key is mapped, or <code>null</code> if this
map contains no mapping for the key<p><strong>See Also:</strong><p><code>put(Object, Object)</code></blockquote><p>Look how verbose the documentation is. Part of the verbosity is ‚Äònecessary‚Äô
to explain the interface‚Äôs unfortunate ambiguity (the meaning of a
<code>null</code> return value), and part of the verbosity is gratuitous (the
meaning of the <code>key</code> parameter, whose name and type make it obvious
to a reader who has read and understood the <code>Map</code> interface).<p>Note also that the documentation as verbose as it is, does not explain the
exceptions that the implementation might throw. The reader has to follow the <a href=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#get(java.lang.Object)>links
up the inheritance chain to find the exceptions</a>.<p>Still, this interface does have the virtue of explaining itself immediately
upon contact, somewhat like the screwdriver. Compare it to Python‚Äôs online
help:<pre>
>>> <strong>help({}.__getitem__)</strong>
Help on built-in function __getitem__:

__getitem__(...)
    x.__getitem__(y) <==> x[y]
</pre><p>And of course, Python exceptions are all run-time exceptions; there is no
equivalent of Java‚Äôs checked exceptions (which make up part of the declared and
statically-checked type of an interface).<p>Between these extremes of annoying verbosity and useless terseness, there is
the admirably concise but eye-rollingly gnomic <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system>Hindley-Milner
type system</a> notation.<p>It‚Äôs easy to imagine, and in C++ and Java easy to actually achieve, interface
definitions that explain themselves concisely like Hindley-Milner, but without
the gnomic Greek. For example, a better <code>Map.get</code> in Java:<pre>
public V get(K key) throws NoSuchKeyException
</pre><p>Or, if you dislike exceptions and like Maybe types as I do,<pre>
public MaybeV get(K key)
</pre><p>Either way, the interface explains itself in 1 concise line, without the
ambiguity of <code>null</code>, with no need for verbosity, and with no need to
crawl up the inheritance chain for more clues. Just as the labels in buttons
like <strong>All Events In The Series</strong> and <strong>Close Without
Saving</strong> explain themselves concisely, the names of types and identifiers
explain themselves to readers who have understood the 1-paragraph definitions of
<code>Map</code> and <code>Maybe</code>. Callers that violate the interface
simply won‚Äôt compile, let alone run‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno nasty run-time surprises like in
Python.<p>(Note that in defining the key type <code>K</code> as the argument type of
<code>get</code>, we avoid another ambiguity in the Java <code>Map</code>
interface: the possibility of <code>ClassCastException</code> (<a href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#get(java.lang.Object)>documented
as ‚Äúoptional‚Äù</a>). Recall from the documentation above that Java‚Äôs
<code>Map.get</code> takes <code>Object</code> as the argument type‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich may
not correctly cast, at run-time (!), to <code>K</code>.)<p>There is a whole rant to be written on another topic I touched on in the last
post: Whether or not an interface‚Äôs guarantee is <em>computable</em>. But, it
will have to wait; for now, it is time to compose these 2 interfaces:<pre>
class Person {
  // ...
  MaybeSatisfaction eat(Eatable* eatable) mutable;
  // ...
}

class ChocolateChipPancake : public Eatable {
  // ...
}
