Rain Nor MITM… An Empirical Analysis of Email Delivery Security”</a> by
Durumeric, et al. confirms my assertion that opportunistic security must be
either useless or rarely adopted:<blockquote>We analyze the mail sent to Gmail from these hosts and find that in
seven countries, more than 20% of all messages are actively prevented from being
encrypted. In the most severe case, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail
are downgraded to cleartext.</blockquote><p>If you actually need STARTTLS, you can’t count on it doing anything. One
solution would be for Gmail to require STARTTLS, and to require some kind of
Certificate Transparency or key pinning for STARTTLS certificates. But then the
next problem would arise: surfacing the connection failures to people. Due to
the asynchronous and ‘it just works’ nature of email, I don’t see an elegant or
even minimally workable solution to that problem. I’d love to be proven
wrong...</aside><p>Original post follows:<hr><p>If an application (or platform, or protocol, or...) cannot communicate a
particular security guarantee to the person — perhaps because there is no
channel by which to communicate the message — then the mechanism that provides
the security guarantee can be at best <em>opportunistic</em>. The mechanism
provides the guarantee if conditions are favorable; otherwise, it does not.<p>With an opportunistic security mechanism, there arises a question: whether or
not the effort to develop the mechanism, and the attack surface the mechanism
exposes, is worth the benefit — which is likely to be negligible.<p>The reason the benefit of an opportunistic security mechanism is likely to be
negligible is that, because the application cannot communicate failures to the
person, the success or failure of the mechanism cannot possibly be part of the
person’s mental model of the system. Thus, the person is very likely to rank
other benefits — such as availability or performance — above the security
benefit that they cannot even perceive.<p>Thus, opportunistic security mechanisms almost certainly must fail open,
rather than fail closed. If an opportunistic security mechanism were to fail
closed, but the application could not communicate a particular reason or
recourse to the person, people would be likely to reject the application as
being flaky and unpredictably unavailable.<p>Thus, in the presence of an attacker, the opportunistic security mechanism
must, by design, be useless or rarely adopted.<p>An application may also fail to communicate the failure of a security
mechanism not because the communication channel to the person is lacking, but
because it is too complex. Too much communication can be just as bad as too
little.<p>If the application cannot communicate the security guarantee to the person
because the semantics of the security are too complex, the application
developers should simplify the security guarantee. Specifically, by simplifying
(or “quantizing”) the security guarantee <em>upward</em>. (Or, equivalently,
quantizing the semantic complexity downward.)<p>For example, it can be very difficult to explain in an application’s UX that
the person’s communications with their friend are encrypted but not
authenticated; or authenticated but not encrypted. Thus, it is better to provide
both authentication and encryption together, and clearly label that state
‘secure’; or to provide neither and clearly label that state ‘non-secure’.
(Alternately, an application whose users will accept occasional unavailability
may instead report a connection error and explain that no ‘secure’ connection is
available at the time.)<p>To <a href=http://iang.org/ssl/h1_the_one_true_cipher_suite.html>paraphrase
Ian Grigg</a>, we can characterize the ultimate security quantization as, “There
is 1 mode, and it is secure”. Allowing less-secure or non-secure modes
complicates the mechanism’s semantics and implementation. Such complexity makes
it difficult both for the people who use the application and the people who
develop the application to model the application’s states accurately.<p>In fact, there is much less of a bright line between ‘developers’ and ‘users’
than either group believes. Developers, just like users, inevitably create
inaccurate models of the application. Developers call it <em>abstraction</em>,
and call it a necessary virtue. And they are right.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
