electronic drums, and keys, building dreamy echoes and drones. This record
is an instant favorite — I am immensely jealous, because this is the kind of
record I would love to have written and played on. The layers of simple
melody and light grooves relax me but keep my interest — it’s sweet, but not
boring.<p>High points: “Awake”, “L”; but every track is gold.<p><em>Guitars, bass, keys, and drums by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_(musician)>Scott Hansen</a>;
guitars and bass by Zac Brown; live drums by Rory O’Connor; Produced by
Scott Hansen.</em></article></main><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the
