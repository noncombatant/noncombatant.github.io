helping others — so that you can help others.<li>Do 1 thing at a time. Multitasking is counter-productive.<li>Eat a moderate amount of a wide variety of foods. Eat breakfast. Reduce (but
don’t completely eliminate) sugar and alcohol.<li>Listen to even more kinds of music, even more often.<li>Read even more kinds of text, even more often. Read more long-form than
short-form.<li>The mind is the body. Meditate, in some form, for at least 30 minutes each
day. Walk at least 10,000 steps each day.<li>Clean your body, clean your clothes, clean your home.<li>Prefer craft and technique to tools. But do use the best tools, and take
care of them.<li>Doubt yourself — but not too much. Doubt yourself before doubting others,
but do avoid confirmed fools.<li>Nail the fundamentals. Be open to improvising around the fundamentals.<li>“The shortest answer is doing the thing.” —  Ernest Hemingway<li>Habits are free. (That can be bad.) Be aware of your habits and break them
