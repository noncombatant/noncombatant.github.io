suggestions at the bottom.</aside><aside><p>Update 2016-07-28: You‚Äôll definitely also want to read my excellent
colleague <a href=https://medium.com/@laparisa/so-you-want-to-work-in-security-bc6c10157d23>Parisa
Tabriz‚Äô take on the same topic</a>.</aside><p>I‚Äôve been talking with various people lately about how to get started in
software security engineering. I noticed I‚Äôve been having similar conversations
with both newbies and experienced engineers, and I figured I should write things
down in 1 place rather than keep repeating myself! I hope someone will find this
useful.<h2>Know Your Reasons</h2><p>Know your reasons for wanting to specialize in security. Here are some
examples; you‚Äôll probably have more of your own:<ul><li>The intellectual challenge excites you<li>You want to help people by making software safer<li>You want to help people by stopping or catching crime<li>You want to refute, ‚ú®with science‚ú®, the false and dangerous claims that
software vendors sometimes make<li>You want to help people by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation#Jailbreaking>giving
them control of closed platforms</a><li>You like the money<li>...</ul><p>You might want to rank your reasons, so that when you‚Äôre faced with career
choices you know what path to follow. For example, you might have a job you like
because it‚Äôs intellectually challenging, but someone comes along and offers you
more money to do less-interesting work. You‚Äôll have to decide which is more
important to you. I find it comforting to have ranked my reasons and goals ahead
of time, because for me it makes the choices much less stressful. And you will
most certainly need a moral compass as you progress through this adventure.<h2>Go For It!</h2><p>You can, and should, get started right away! Yes, there is a lot to learn,
but you can do it, and you can start being effective immediately. I know this
from first-hand experience, and from seeing other people do it. You might feel
daunted by the size of the problem ‚Äî everyone is, whether they admit it or not.
The only way anyone has ever made progress is bit by bit, and you can too.<p>There are more security problems right now than there are problem solvers. We
need you!<h2>Security Engineering Is Just Engineering</h2><p>Security is a specialization within the overall field of software
engineering. In that sense, it is no different than any other specialization
like networking, databases, performance, games, or whatever else. And software
engineering is much more than just reading and writing code ‚Äî¬†it also includes
design, technical and non-technical writing and communication, interpersonal and
political skills, at least some understanding of business and economics, and
more. Security engineers need those skills, too. Code is definitely important
but it is not the whole story.<p>You can learn the general partly by focusing on the specific ‚Äî and you can
learn the specific by learning the general. That is, you can learn engineering
by diving right into security specifically, and you can also learn about
security by learning engineering generally. (After all, security is really just
another form of engineering quality.)<p>I find it‚Äôs best to try to view things from both perspectives. In my
experience, it has been productive to focus on security specifically for a
while, then focus on application development for a while, and then iterate.<p>Within the field of software security engineering, there are
sub-specializations. My main area is application security engineering: figuring
out what kinds of assets and attacks on those assets are relevant in a
particular application‚Äôs domain, and then trying to design and implement the
application to best defend its assets. But there are other sub-specializations
in security, such as digital forensics and incident response (DFIR), network
security, anti-fraud (a close relative of actuarial science and statistics),
anti-abuse/pro-social design, and more.<h2>The Security Mindset: Doubt Abstractions And Dependencies</h2><p>The most important thing about a good security engineer is their mindset:
skeptical. A regular engineer is trying to build something that works; a
security engineer is anxious until they‚Äôve found a few new ways in which it
doesn‚Äôt work.<p>Much of computing science and software engineering is about managing
complexity by creating abstractions. For example, consider this Python code:<pre>
f = open("something.txt", "r")
</pre><p>Python gives us this simple way to say, ‚ÄúGive me an object that represents a
persistent data store, and let me read that data.‚Äù But that straightforward code
hides tons and tons of complexity. For example, we have no idea (without reading
the Python interpreter and standard library source code) exactly how that object
<code>f</code> works (nor what it costs). It could be a thin wrapper around the
C library‚Äôs <code>FILE</code> type, which itself is a rather thick (and useful)
wrapper around the operating system‚Äôs <em>file descriptor</em> or
<em>handle</em> concept. In turn, file descriptors are abstract representations
of a wide variety of hardware and software systems:<ul><li>Possibly volatile, possibly not<li>Possibly stored on a device attached to this computer ‚Äî¬†or possibly
remote, retrieved over the network in a way that might violate your expectations
for integrity or confidentiality<li>Possibly stored on any kind of hardware: spinning disk, tape, SSD ‚Äî¬†all with
wildly different performance and reliability properties<li>Possibly cached at 1 or more places in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy>memory hierarchy</a> ‚Äî¬†and
possibly stale or inconsistent</ul><p>The <em>pathname</em> of the file, in this case <code>something.txt</code>,
is also a very high-level abstraction. Different platforms implement different
pathname interpretation semantics, but most do a lot of work to hide complexity.
For example, on Unix-like platforms, pathnames can refer to a variety of kinds
of things:<ul><li>Hardware devices (e.g. <code>/dev/disk1</code>)<li>Software ‚Äòpseudo-devices‚Äô (e.g. <code>/dev/pty0</code>)<li>Special operating system facilities (e.g. <code>/dev/bpf3</code>,
<code>/dev/urandom</code>)<li>Remote services on the network (e.g.
<code>/mnt/nfs/your-companys-file-server/accounting/FY2016Q3
Report.xls</code>)<li>And more...</ul><p><a href=https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-definitive-guide-on-win32-to-nt.html>Windows
systems have even stranger pathname semantics</a>. PHP will also interpret
pathnames as URLs and <a href=http://php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php>will
perform certain transformations of the data based on the URL scheme!</a><h3>Abstractions Are Lossy ‚Äî¬†And Vulnerable</h3><p>They have to be ‚Äî¬†that‚Äôs their value! The purpose of an abstraction is to
hide complexity, and thereby help you get work done faster. An abstraction that
does not hide something from its caller is not an abstraction at all.<p>But a security engineer is always skeptical, because they know that in the
gap between what the abstraction <em>seems to provide</em> and what it
<em>actually provides</em>, there are exploitable vulnerabilities.<p>Neal Stephenson called this <em>metaphor shear</em> (like windshear) in his
hilarious essay <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-was-Command-Line/dp/0380815931/>In The
Beginning Was The Command Line</a>.<p>In general, it‚Äôs good engineering practice to <strong>understand the layer
below where you‚Äôre working, and understand the layer above</strong>. Another way
to say this is, <a href=/2014/08/10/security-as-a-class-of-interface-guarantee/><strong>know your
callees, and know your callers</strong></a>. The difference between an engineer
and a security engineer is that the security engineer is looking for the tension
and friction in those edges.<h2>Skills</h2><p>For the rest of this post, I‚Äôll talk about what skills I have found useful in
application security. But there are other areas, and other paths into them
‚Äî¬†this is just one person‚Äôs perspective!<h3>Foundations</h3><p>Certain skills will be of use throughout your career and will help you build
a foundation from which you can learn anything else you need to learn.<ul><li>Know at least 1 programming language (C, Ruby, Python, Java, et c.) in
depth.<li>Know the standard library of your programming language as well as possible.
This includes collections types (lists, <a href=/2014/03/02/maps-and-their-applications/>maps</a>, et c.), basic file
I/O, basic networking, basic text processing, and so on.<li>Know at least 1 platform (iOS, Linux, web, Windows, et c.) in depth.<li>Know at least the basics of TCP/IP. Spend some quality time with <a href=https://www.amazon.com/TCP-Illustrated-Protocols-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321336313/><em>TCP/IP
Illustrated</em></a> and <a href=https://www.wireshark.org/>Wireshark</a>.</ul><h3>Progressing</h3><p>After some years building your foundations, there are more things to learn
and more adventures to enjoy. Here are some:<ul><li>Master additional languages and platforms<li>Contribute to the implementation of a language or platform<li>Learn about cryptography, and what it does and does not provide<li>Learn about hardware engineering<li>Learn programming language theory<li>Branch out into platform security engineering (changing platforms, and
developing new platforms, to better serve application security needs)<li>Study distributed systems theory<li>Learn about performance engineering ‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs important to make sure that
security mechanisms are not the cause of performance problems!<li>Learn user experience design, so you can build secure <a href=https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/399.pdf><em>ceremonies</em></a></ul><h2>Some Light Reading</h2><p>To thoroughly learn a programming language, I find it useful to read 1 very
well written book that covers the language‚Äôs syntax, semantics, standard
library, and usage conventions. I like to read the book cover to cover, and then
re-read all or part of it periodically. Preferably, 1 or more of the language‚Äôs
inventors or implementors should have written the book. The canonical example is
<em>The C Programming Language</em> by Kernighan and Ritchie, and other books
have continued and improved on the tradition: <em>The Go Programming
Language</em> by Donovan and Kernighan; <em>JavaScript: The Definitive
Guide</em> by Flanagan; <em>The Java Programming Language</em> by Arnold,
Gosling, and Holmes; and <em>Effective C++</em> by Meyers. People on Twitter say
that <a href=http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/><em>The Hitchhiker‚Äôs
Guide To Python</em></a> by Reitz is a good Python book.<p>Saltzer and Schroeder‚Äôs <a href=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs551/saltzer/><em>The Protection Of
Information In Computer Systems</em></a> is a foundational text.<p>For web security, I recommend <em>The Tangled Web</em> by <a href=http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/>Michal Zalewski</a>. Zalewski also has
another excellent book, <em>Silence On The Wire</em>, about techniques for
passive surveillance in a variety of domains. Zalewski is also the author of <a href=http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/>American Fuzzy Lop</a>, an excellent <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing>fuzzer</a>.<p><em>Cryptography Engineering</em> by Ferguson, Schneier, and Kohno is a good
introduction to applied cryptography.<p><em>TCP/IP Illustrated</em>, at least volume 1, is crucial.<p>For understanding C and doing reverse engineering, you‚Äôll want a good
assembly language book, such as <a href=https://www.nostarch.com/assembly2.htm><em>Art Of Assembly Language</em>
by Hyde</a>.<p>Ross Anderson‚Äôs excellent omnibus, <em>Security Engineering</em>, is <a href=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html>available online</a> and on
paper. Another great book is <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Art-Software-Security-Assessment-Vulnerabilities/dp/0321444426><em>The
Art Of Software Security Assessment</em></a> by Dowd, McDonald, and Schuh.<p>There are many also good blogs and magazines. A random sampling might include
<a href=https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/>the Project Zero blog</a>, <a href=https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/>PoC||GTFO</a>, <a href=http://blog.invisiblethings.org/>Joanna Rutkowska‚Äôs blog</a>, and <a href=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com>Matthew Green‚Äôs blog</a>.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is
