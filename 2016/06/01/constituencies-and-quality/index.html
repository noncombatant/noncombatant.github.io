Labs report on Windows OEM bloatware vulnerabilities, ‚ÄúOut-Of-Box
Exploitation‚Äù</a>, I was struck by a thought: the reason Apple hardware does not
have the vulnerable bloatware problem is that Apple does not have a bloatware
problem at all. And the reason for that is that Apple prioritizes the customer‚Äôs
happiness above all, and the out-of-box experience in particular. So much so, in
fact, that people fetishize taking the product out of its packaging. This video,
one of who-knows-how-many, has 737,414 views on YouTube:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LzEi3aJtde0 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen loading=lazy></iframe><p>So although Microsoft employs very good engineers, including very good
security engineers, the end result is awful. What went wrong?<p>Microsoft famously (historically, and apparently still) catered first to
application developers (independent software vendors, or ISVs) and to OEMs.
Microsoft saw, or sees, OEMs and large enterprises as their true customers;
Apple sees individuals as their true customers. Apple wants to make money by
making you love their machines, while Microsoft wants to make money by helping
OEMs make money.<p>Obviously, both approaches work great, even though the results are wildly
different and have huge implications for software security internet-wide.
Interesting to note is that when you can be Microsoft‚Äôs direct customer, such as
when you are buying thousands of MSDN seats or large IIS and SQL Server
deployments, you do in fact get Apple-level care and quality.<p>One way of understanding that is to observe that, of course, paying customers
get the quality they want. But I don‚Äôt think that fully explains what‚Äôs going
on; after all, Dell‚Äôs and Acer‚Äôs customers paid money. Is it simply a matter of
margins?<p>I‚Äôm not sure it is, because Duo Labs found the same problems even with the
premium Microsoft Signature Edition machines, even the premium-/business-grade
Lenovos. I think Microsoft baked the security and user-experience quality
problems into the platform when they decided to prioritize the needs and
preferences of OEMs and large enterprises over those of individual people using
the systems.<p>Especially now that we increasingly live in a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device>mixed
enterprise/personal computing environment</a> ‚Äî¬†BYOD started because executives
wanted to use their fancy iDevices at work, because the devices were so good! ‚Äî
<a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies>prioritizing
the needs and preferences of the people actually using the systems</a> to actually
do work seems increasingly like a fundamentally good decision for security, user
experience, and quality generally.<footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property="cc:attributionName" rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is
