LWN about C11 atomic variables and the kernel</a> that struck me for a few
reasons:<ul><li>Atomics and concurrency are always weird and fun and surprising<li>I keep hoping for C11 to be kind of awesome, or at least interesting, and it
is!<li>Although they might not frame it this way, secure usability — <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qmpl-5epx0B5C2t4XsUTyjgbwab_rXfK_4iHqX3IC30/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.gf44795496_0_1">in
the same sense that we worry about it in Chrome</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfFjde0UPbY">see also</a>) —  is a
make-or-break concern for these Linux kernel developers and C standardizers</ul><p>In Chrome Land, we’re always trying to improve people’s ability to understand
and effectively use Chrome’s security indicators and controls, such as the
Location Icon (the green padlock, the red padlock, et c.), the Origin Info
Bubble (the bubble you get when you click on the Location Icon), the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/security-panel?hl=en">Security
Panel in the Dev Tools</a>, the permissions and Content Settings, the security
exceptions in the JavaScript Console, and so on. (By “people”, you can see that
I mean everyone: ‘end-users’, web developers, system and network administrators,
et al. Those categories are fluid.)<p>Similarly, the LWN article describes how the Linux kernel developers and C11
standardizers are trying to improve C developers’ ability to understand and
effectively use atomic variables so that we can all enjoy efficient yet safe
concurrent programs. If the mechanisms that enable concurrency (like locks and
atomics) are confusing, we’re going to get buggy (and vulnerable) programs. But
if they’re too slow or heavyweight, people won’t use them —  and we’ll get buggy
(and vulnerable) programs.<p>So the first thing to do is to find out what it is that the community using
the product needs and can effectively use. So the C11 standards people, academic
programming language researchers, and kernel developers are all working together
to figure out the shape of the thing.<p>Here is a representative example of the kinds of problems that crop up:<blockquote><p>Another area of concern is control dependencies: situations where atomic
variables and control flow interact. Consider a simple bit of code:<pre>
x = atomic_load(&a, memory_order_relaxed);
if (x)
    atomic_store(&y, 42, memory_order_relaxed);
</pre><p>The setting of <code>y</code> has a control dependency on the value of
<code>x</code>. But the C11 standard does not currently address control
dependencies at all, meaning that the compiler or processor could play with the
order of the two atomic operations, or even try to optimize the branch out
altogether; see <a href=https://lwn.net/Articles/586854/>this explanation from
GCC developer Torvald Riegel</a> for details. Again, the results of this kind of
optimization in the kernel context could be disastrous.<p>For cases like this, Paul suggested that some additional source-code markup
and a new <code>memory_order_control</code> memory model could be used in the
kernel to make the control dependency explicit:<pre>
x = atomic_load(&a, memory_order_control);
if (control_dependency(x))
    atomic_store(&b, 42, memory_order_relaxed);
</pre><p>But this approach is unlikely to be taken, given just how unhappy Linus was
with the idea. From his point of view, the control dependency should be obvious — the code is testing the value of <code>x</code>, after all. Any compiler that
would move the <code>atomic_store()</code> operation in an externally visible
way, he said, is simply broken.</blockquote><p>Just as with ‘end-user’ interfaces, these low-level APIs must adapt to the
needs and expectations of the people who use them. Despite the tendency to
consider ‘end-users’ as ‘ignorant’ or ‘not computer-literate’, and the tendency
to consider kernel hackers as ‘elite’, these different groups have concerns
about and problems with the usability of their every-day tools that are more
similar than people sometimes imagine.<p>Another thing that struck me is that magic simply may not be possible, and
our best recourse might just be to live with the limitations of simplicity.
Linus’ way of saying this is arresting:<blockquote><p>Yet another concern is global optimization. Compiler developers are
increasingly trying to optimize programs at the level of entire source files, or
even larger groups of files. This kind of optimization can work well as long as
the compiler truly understands how variables are used. But the compiler is not
required to understand the real hardware that the program is running on; it is,
instead, required to prove its decisions against a virtual machine defined by
the standard. If the real computer behaves in ways that differ from the virtual
machine, things can go wrong.<p>Consider this example raised by Linus: the compiler might look at how the
kernel accesses page table entries and notice that no code ever sets the “page
dirty” bit. It might then conclude that any tests against that bit could simply
be optimized out. But that bit can change; it’s just that the hardware makes the
change, not the kernel code. So any optimizations made based on the notion that
the compiler can “prove” that bit will never be set will lead to bad things.
Linus concluded: “Any optimization that tries to prove anything from more than
local state is by definition broken, because it assumes that everything is
described by the program.”</blockquote><p>The article describes the existing concurrency tools that the Linux kernel
developers built for themselves, that the C11 mechanisms would attempt to
replace. The kernel developers understand the tools they made, and they seem to
work, and maybe that’s sufficient.<p>I can’t help but be reminded of how a web browser cannot always ‘decide’ for
the person that a certificate validation error is or is not important: it
depends on context that is simply not available to the program interpreting its
impoverished input. Whether it’s the compiler trying to interpret kernel source
code or the browser trying to interpret an X.509 certificate chain, there’s
often simply not enough information to produce an output that is both correct
and optimal.<p>There is also a problem of unaligned incentives that contribute to the secure
usability problem, just as we often see happen in the Web PKI and in the design,
implementation, and use of the Open Web Platform: different groups of people
have different interests and are under different pressures, and sometimes their
goals come into conflict.<blockquote>The problem is that compilers tend to be judged on the speed of the
code they generate, so compiler developers have a strong incentive to optimize
code to the greatest extent possible. Sometimes those optimizations can break
code that is not written with an attentive eye toward the standard; the kernel
developers’ perspective is that compiler developers will often rely on a
legalistic reading of standards to justify “optimizations” that (from the kernel
developer’s viewpoint) make no sense and break code needlessly. Highly
concurrent code, as is found in the kernel, tends to be more susceptible to
optimization-caused problems than just about anything else. So kernel developers
have learned to be careful.</blockquote><p>This pressure — speed, speed, speed! —  leads compiler developers to make the
language opaque, and to break the conceptual integrity of the language in a way
that can actually make it unsafe and unusable:<blockquote><blockquote>There are too many compiler optimisations for people to reason
directly in terms of the set of all transformations that they do, so we need
some more concise and comprehensible envelope identifying what is allowed, as an
interface between compiler writers and users.</blockquote><p>The C11 standard is meant to be that “envelope,” though, as Peter admitted,
it is “not yet fully up to that task.” But if the remaining uncertainties and
problems can be addressed, C11 atomics could become a common language with which
developers can reason about concurrency and allowable optimizations. Developers
might come to understand the issues better, and kernel code might become a bit
more widely accessible to developers who understand the standard.</blockquote><p>Cryptographer Dan Bernstein <a href=https://cr.yp.to/talks/2015.04.16/slides-djb-20150416-a4.pdf>has been
saying a similar thing</a>: Do compilers actually <em>need</em> to produce
high-performance code, in the general case? Where needed, <em>can</em> they? And
if not, is the damage to the language’s conceptual integrity worth it? He
contends (as I read him, at least) that the answer to these questions is No:
Most code is not hot (run often and hence in need of optimization); and, true
hot spots require optimizations that compilers cannot yet perform — only humans,
locally optimizing, understand their application domain and their machine well
enough to get a good result. (Bernstein is generally working on cryptographic
algorithms that he optimizes to work absolutely as well as possible on each
distinct chip —  local optimizables that the general-purpose (‘global’, if you
will) compiler optimizations don’t really help with.) From Bernstein’s
presentation:<blockquote>Mike Pall, LuaJIT author, 2011: “If you write an interpreter loop in
assembler, you can do much better... There’s just no way you can reasonably
expect even the most advanced C compilers to do this on your
behalf.”</blockquote><p>Thus it might not be that people need optimizing compilers; instead, they may
benefit more from dumb-but-conceptually-integral compilers, and more usable
tools for writing, profiling, and testing hand-written assembly code.<p>I think we can learn a few widely-applicable UX design lessons from all this
compiler talk:<ul><li>Augment the human, rather than try (and fail) to replace them.<li>Optimize locally only —  we know that we don’t know everything we need to
know to best serve people.<li>Check that the local optimizations are actually optimizations.<li>Never violate the conceptual integrity of the system.<li>Sometimes it’s better to give people tools to build their own tools, rather
than try to build The Ultimate Thing.</ul><footer><p><a href=https://noncombatant.org/>noncombatant.org</a> by <a xmlns:cc=http://creativecommons.org/ns# href=mailto:chris@noncombatant.org property=cc:attributionName rel=cc:attributionurl>Chris Palmer</a> is in the Creative Commons,
